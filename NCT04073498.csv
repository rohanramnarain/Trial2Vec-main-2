NCT04073498,The Safety and Tolerability of SerpinPC in Healthy Men and in Men with Severe Blood Disorders (haemophilia a and B),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04073498,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and activity in the body of a new drug called SerpinPC.

The study will be split into 7 parts: Part 1a will be conducted in healthy male volunteers in the UK (up to 15) and Parts 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be conducted in haemophilia A \& B patients in Moldova and Georgia.

Part 1a of the study will look at how safe the drug is when given as single doses to healthy volunteers at different strengths and via 2 different routes of administration (through a vein or via an injection under the skin). Parts 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the study will look at the safety of the drug when given as an injection under the skin to patients with severe haemophilia A or B.

The study will also investigate how the levels of the drug in the blood change over a period of time and how the drug acts in the body by taking blood samples. These blood samples will measure the concentration of the drug in the blood and measure certain aspects of the blood to determine how the drug affects them.

The study sponsor (ApcinteX) is developing this drug for the treatment of haemophilia A and haemophilia B, which are 2 types of rare blood disorders which affect the body's ability to form blood clots. Patients who have haemophilia A and B do not have certain clotting factors in their blood which means that they experience difficulty in stopping bleeding after injury and can be prone to extended periods of bleeding.

Current treatments for haemophilia involves injections which replace the missing factors in the blood. However these treatments are short term and therefore patients require regular treatments in order to manage the condition.

Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective treatments which provide longer term benefits. The aim of SerpinPC is to prevent bleeding rather than to have to treat bleeds to minimise pain and damage after they have occurred.",NO,Hemophilia a|Hemophilia B,DRUG: SerpinPC|DRUG: Placebo,"Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Number of Participants with One or More Drug Related Adverse Events (AEs) or any Serious AEs, From Day 1 up to 74 weeks","PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - Cmax, Maximal concentration, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - Tmax, Time of maximal concentration, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - kel, Elimination rate constant, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - t1/2, Terminal elimination half-life, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - AUC, Area under the concentration-time curve, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - AUC0-t, Area under the concentration-time curve from time of dosing to last measureable concentration, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - AUC0-inf, Area under the concentration-time curve from time of dosing extrapolated to infinity., From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK of SerpinPC in plasma after single dose administration - AUC%, Residual area under the concentration-time curve., From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - Cmax, Maximal concentration, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - Tmax, Time to maximal concentration, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - Kel, Elimination rate constant, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - t1/2, Terminal elimination half-life, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - AUC, Area under the concentration-time curve, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - AUC(0-Ï„), Area under the concentration-time curve from time of dosing to the end of the dosing interval, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - R0, Accumulation ratio, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|PK following multiple dose administration - Ctrough, Trough concentration, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks","Effect of SerpinPC on Annualised Bleeding Rate and factor usage, Descriptive statistics of actual absolute and change from baseline values will be summarized, From Day 1 up to 26 weeks|Effect of SerpinPC on Annualised Bleeding Rate following extended monthly dosing, Descriptive statistics of actual absolute and change from baseline values will be summarized, From Day 1 up to 74 weeks",ApcinteX Ltd,Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc,MALE,ADULT,PHASE1|PHASE2,39,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,AP-0101,2019-08-14,2024-09-26,2024-09-26,2019-08-29,,2025-02-06,"Arensia Clinical Research Unit, Tbilisi, 0112, Georgia|Arensia Clinical Research Unit, Chisinau, Moldova, Republic of|Simbec Research Ltd, Merthyr Tydfil, Cardiff, CF48 4DR, United Kingdom",
