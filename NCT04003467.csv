NCT04003467,A Six-month Phase 2 Study of Oral hPTH(1-34) (EBP05) in Postmenopausal Women With Low Bone Mass,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04003467,,COMPLETED,"This is a double-blinded randomized study to determine the effects of treatment on biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption, and bone mineral density (BMD) for 6 months of treatment with EBP05 or placebo. Approximately 160 postmenopausal women with low bone mass (BMD T-score lower than or equal to -2.0 in at least one location: Lumbar Spine, Femoral Neck or Total Hip sites) over 50 years of age will receive Study Medication. Protocol Version 3.0 describes the treatment and evaluation of the initial 103 subjects randomized. In Protocol Version 4.0 the treatment phase will consist of 4 different treatment arms as follows:

Oral EBP05 0.5mg x3 tablets (1.5mg), N=6 Oral EBP05 0.5mg x5 tablets (2.5mg), N=36 Oral Placebo for EBP05 0.5mg (split to sub-groups of: 3 or 5 tablets), N=18",NO,Osteoporosis,DRUG: EBP05|DRUG: Placebo of EBP05,"Mean % change in P1NP from baseline after 3 months of treatment, Determine the change in P1NP from baseline during treatment with oral EBP05 for 3 months compared with the change during treatment with placebo, baseline, 3 months","Mean % change in BMD (lumbar) from baseline after 6 months of treatment, Determine the change in BMD (lumbar spine) from Baseline at Month 6 compared with the change during treatment with placebo, baseline, 6 months|Mean % change in BMD (Femoral Neck and Total Hip) from baseline after 6 months of treatment, Determine the change in BMD (Femoral Neck and Total Hip) from Baseline at Month 6 compared with the change during treatment with placebo., baseline, 6 months|Mean % change in P1NP from baseline after 6 months of treatment, Determine the change in P1NP from baseline during treatment with oral EBP05 for 6 months compared with the change during treatment with placebo., baseline, 6 months|Mean % change in osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase from baseline after 6 months of treatment, Determine the changes in osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase from baseline during treatment with oral EBP05 for 3 and 6 months compared with the change during treatment with placebo., baseline, 6 months|Mean % change in serum CTX and urine NTX/Creatinine from baseline after 3 months of treatment, Determine the change in serum CTX and urine NTX/Creatinine from baseline during treatment with oral EBP05 for 3 months compared with the change during treatment with placebo., baseline, 3 months|Mean % change in serum CTX and urine NTX/Creatinine from baseline after 6 months of treatment Change of BMD (lumbar) after 6 months of treatment, Determine the changes in serum CTX and urine NTX/Creatinine from baseline during treatment with oral EBP05 for 6 months compared with the change during treatment with placebo., baseline, 6 months|Concentration of plasma hPTH(1-34) 15 min after Study Medication administration, Provide descriptive statistics of plasma hPTH(1-34) concentration 15 min. after Study Medication administration at Day 1, Month 1, Month 3 and Month 6 by treatment group, 6 months","Mean % change in urine cyclic AMP/ creatinine by treatment groups, Determine the effect of treatment with EBP05 and placebo on urine cyclic AMP/ creatinine (total urine collected over 1.5-hour post dose) on Day 1, Month 1, Month 3 and Month 6 as a pharmacodynamic response to EPB05, 6 months|Correlation between mean urine cyclic AMP/ creatinine at Month 3 and Month 6 and mean % change in P1NP from baseline at Months 3 and 6, Evaluate the correlation between urine cyclic AMP/ creatinine (total urine collected over 1.5-hour post dose) at Month 3 and Month 6 and P1NP change from baseline at Months 3 and 6, 6 months|Correlation between plasma hPTH(1-34) and urine cyclic AMP/ creatinine at different timepoints, Evaluate the correlation between plasma hPTH(1-34) 15 minutes after oral administration of EBP05 and urine cyclic AMP/ creatinine (total urine collected over 1.5-hour post dose)., 6 months",Entera Bio Ltd.,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,161,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",ENT-07-2019,2019-06-30,2021-04-27,2021-05-11,2019-07-01,,2021-06-28,"Hadassah Medical Center, Mt.
