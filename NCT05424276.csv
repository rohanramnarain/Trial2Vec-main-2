NCT05424276,"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of IkT-148009 in Untreated Parkinson's Disease",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05424276,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This study investigates the safety and tolerability of drug IkT-148009 in untreated Parkinson's disease volunteers (30 to 80 years old). It also looks at the pharmacokinetics of IkT-148009 in the body and evaluates the effect of IkT-148009 on motor and non-motor features of the disease. This 12 week study is designed to be 3:1 randomized across 3 doses of IkT-148009 or placebo. Each participant will self-administer one of 3 doses or placebo of IkT-148009 once daily (QD) with food for 12 weeks.
