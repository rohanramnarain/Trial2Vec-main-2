NCT06185673,A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Clinical Activity of Intramuscular Doses of BB-301 Administered to Subjects With Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy With Dysphagia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06185673,,RECRUITING,"Subjects who have enrolled in the oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) natural history study (Study BNTC-OPMD-NH-001) and have completed at least 6 months of follow up in Study BNTC-OPMD-NH-001 may be eligible to participate in this study, where all subjects will be treated with a single dose of BB-301. BB-301 will be injected directly into the middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle of the throat through the use of an open surgical procedure conducted under general anesthesia. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of BB-301, to identify the best dose of BB-301 to administer to patients, and to characterize how well BB-301 works to improve the symptoms of dysphagia in patients with OPMD.",NO,Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy,GENETIC: BB-301: Dose escalation phase 1b cohort 1|GENETIC: BB-301: Dose escalation phase 1b cohort 2|GENETIC: BB-301: Dose escalation phase 1b cohort 3|GENETIC: BB-301: Dose expansion phase 2a,"Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in phase 1b, A DLT will be defined using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, as follows:

DIGEST uses 2 component scores to quantify pharyngeal bolus transit: 1) safety profile (i.e., penetration/aspiration); and 2) efficiency profile (i.e., residue). Higher scores are indicative of more severe dysphagia, with 0 = no dysphagia, 1 = mild dysphagia, 2 = moderate dysphagia, 3 = severe dysphagia, and 4 = life-threatening dysphagia)., Baseline, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270, Day 360|Phase 1b: Swallowing efficiency as measured by the Normalized Residue Ratio Scale (NRRS), The NRRS is a continuous measurement for capturing residue severity using pixel-based measurements during videofluoroscopy that incorporate the ratio of residue relative to the available pharyngeal space and the residue proportionate to the size of the individual. ""Pharyngeal residue"" is a medical term used to describe material that remains in the pharynx post-swallow and is considered a sign of swallowing impairment.

Pharyngeal residue collects most commonly in: 1) the valleculae, bilateral spaces between the base of the tongue and the epiglottis (measured by the NRRSv); and 2) the pyriform sinuses, spaces formed on either side of the pharynx between the fibers of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the sides of the thyroid cartilage and lined by orthogonally directed fibers of the palatopharyngeus muscle and pharyngobasilar fascia (measured by the NRRSp)., Baseline, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270, Day 360|Phase 1b: Pharyngeal constrictor muscle function as estimated by the Pharyngeal Constriction Ratio (PCR), The PCR was created to quantify the efficiency of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing via videofluoroscopy and was demonstrated to be a surrogate for pharyngeal muscle strength. The PCR is a pixel-based measure made on lateral view videofluoroscopy swallow study frames. The PCR is calculated by tracing the unobliterated area of the pharynx (including the bolus) at the point of maximum constriction during the swallow and then dividing that area by a corresponding area measure when the pharynx is at rest. Maximum constriction is measured during a 20 cc swallow of liquid barium, and the pharyngeal area at rest is measured with a 1 mL bolus being held in the mouth prior to swallow initiation., Baseline, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270, Day 360|Phase 1b: Maximum pharyngeal dilation as estimated by %(C2-4)^2-normalized post-swallow hyoid rest pharyngeal area (HRAN), Maximum pharyngeal dilation will be estimated by HRAN. The post-swallow hyoid rest is defined as the earliest frame in videofluoroscopic swallowing study recordings following upper esophageal sphincter closure when the hyoid was observed to have descended and moved posteriorly to reach its original, pre-swallow position.

The SSQ is a 17-item questionnaire which was developed to measure symptomatic severity of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia as reported by the affected subject. The questionnaire uses a 100-mm long visual analogue scale for all but 1 question. Possible scores range from 0 to 1700, with higher scores indicating greater swallowing difficulty., Baseline, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270, Day 360|Phase 1b: Subject-reported oropharyngeal dysphagia as assessed by the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) Functional Diet Scale, The IDDSI Functional Diet Scale is a subject-reported oropharyngeal dysphagia functional outcome scale intended to capture the severity of oropharyngeal dysphagia, as represented by the degree of diet texture restriction recommended for the subject. The IDDSI framework consists of a continuum of 8 levels (0-7), where drinks are measured from Levels 0-4, while foods are measured from Levels 3-7. The IDDSI framework provides a common terminology to describe food textures and drink thickness.
