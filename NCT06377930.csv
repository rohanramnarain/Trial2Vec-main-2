NCT06377930,Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of RAP-219 in Adult Participants With Refractory Focal Epilepsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06377930,,RECRUITING,This is a clinical research study for an investigational drug called RAP-219 in patients with Refractory Focal Epilepsy. This study is being conducted to determine if RAP-219 works and is safe in patients with Refractory Focal Epilepsy.,NO,Focal Onset Seizures,DRUG: RAP-219,"Efficacy in reducing frequency of RNS-recorded long episodes in participants with FOS, Change in long episode frequency on treatment compared to baseline, Screening until 5 months after enrollment","Measurement of estimated electrographic seizure frequency from available RNS-recorded episodes, Change in 28-day estimated electrographic seizure frequency, Screening until 5 months after enrollment|Measurement of Clinical Seizure Frequency, Measurement of 28-day clinical Seizure Frequency by paper diary, Screening until 5 months after enrollment|Change in seizure severity, Measurement of seizure severity by participant rating scale of the Seizure Severity Scale. Seizure severity will be assessed by asking participants to respond to 4 questions using a 0-10 numerical rating scale and circling the number that best describes how their seizures have impacted them since their last study visit. Higher scores = higher impact., Screening until 5 months after enrollment|Global Impression of Change, Change in overall clinical status as measured by Clinical Global Impression of Change scores rated by investigator and participant. Both the participant (PGIC) and the clinician (CGIC) will rate their global impression of changes in the participant's condition throughout the study. The CGI scale measures the change in the participant's clinical status from a specific point in time, i.e., the Baseline Period and is rated on a 7-point likert scale ranging from a score of 1 for very much improved to 7 for very much worse. Higher scores = worse outcome., Screening until 5 months after enrollment|Pharmacokinetic parameters, Analysis of plasma concentrations of RAP-219, Dosing until 5 months after dosing",,Rapport Therapeutics Inc.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,20,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,RAP-219-FOS-201,2024-10-10,2025-03-01,2025-06-01,2024-04-22,,2025-03-10,"Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, 06519, United States|Emory Brain Health Center, Atlanta, Georgia, 30329, United States|Consultants in Epilepsy and Neurology, PLLC, Boise, Idaho, 83702, United States|IU Health Neuroscience Center, Goodman Hall, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|The University of Kansas Medical Center Epilepsy Clinic, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160, United States|Corewell Health Research Institute, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 49503, United States|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, New York, New York, 10016, United States|Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195, United States|University of Pennsylvania - Department of Neurology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19107, United States|Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 770300, United States|University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States",
