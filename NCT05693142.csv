NCT05693142,AFFINITY DUCHENNE: RGX-202 Gene Therapy in Participants with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05693142,,RECRUITING,"RGX-202 is a gene therapy designed to deliver a transgene for a novel microdystrophin that includes functional elements of naturally-occurring dystrophin including the C-Terminal (CT) domain.

This is a multicenter, open-label dose evaluation clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous (IV) dose of RGX-202 in participants with Duchenne.",NO,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,GENETIC: RGX-202,"Part 1 Safety measured by incidence of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Evaluate incidences of AEs and SAEs, 52 weeks|Part 2 and 3 Pharmacodynamic, Proportion of participants whose RGX-202 microdystrophin expression determined in their muscle biopsy is â‰¥ 10%, 12 weeks","Time to Stand (TTSTAND), Values will include time (seconds) and velocity (tasks/second), 52 Weeks (Part 1) and 104 Weeks (Part 2 &3)|Time to Walk/Run 10 meters (TTWR), Values will include time (seconds) and velocity (meters/second), 52 Weeks (Part 1) and 104 Weeks (Part 2 &3)|Time to Climb 4 Stairs (TTCLIMB), Values will include time (seconds) and velocity (tasks/second), 52 Weeks (Part 1) and 104 Weeks (Part 2 &3)|North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), Performance-based assessment of muscle strength and function using a 17-item scale, with all items rated 0,1, or 2, with higher score indicating better performance. The NSAA total score is the sum of the 17 items, ranging from 0 to 34. NSAA linearized score ranges from 0 to 100., 52 Weeks (Part 1) and 104 Weeks (Part 2 &3)|Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, Third Edition (PDMS-3); Body Control Subtest, The PDMS-3 is a norm-referenced developmental assessment that measures motor skills of young children. The Body Control subtest measures the child's ability to maintain balance and postural reactions in a variety of positions. Motor skills appropriate for the child's developmental level are administered and rated 0, 1, or 2, with higher score indicating better performance. Body Control subtest total raw scores range from 0 to 112. Age equivalent and scaled scores will also be generated., 52 Weeks (Part 1) and 104 Weeks (Part 2 &3)|Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, Third Edition (PDMS-3); Body Transport Subtest, The PDMS-3 is a norm-referenced developmental assessment that measures motor skills of young children. The Body Transport subtest measures the child's ability to move from one place to another, including walking, running, jumping forward, and skipping. Motor skills appropriate for the child's developmental level are administered and rated 0, 1, or 2, with higher score indicating better performance. Body Transport subtest total raw score ranges from 0 to 63. Age equivalent and scaled scores will also be generated., 52 Weeks (Part 1) and 104 Weeks (Part 2 &3)|Part 2 and 3: Stride velocity 95th centile, Assessment of peak ambulatory performance captured by wearable activity monitoring device.
