NCT03464019,NCT03464019_chunk_0,"Title: Efficacy and Safety of Etripamil for the Termination of Spontaneous Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT). Brief Summary: This was a three-part, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etripamil nasal spray (NS) self-administered by participants who experienced an episode of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) in an at-home setting. NODE-301 Part 1 included participants that received the randomized study drug to treat an episode of PSVT until the 150th positively adjudicated PSVT episode.

NCT04163185,NCT04163185_chunk_0,"Title: Initiating Early Control of Migraine Pain and Associated Symptoms Brief Summary: AXS-07 is an oral, investigational medicine consisting of MoSEIC meloxicam and rizatriptan, which is being developed for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. AXS-07 tablets are formulated to provide an enhanced rate of absorption of meloxicam. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXS-07 compared to placebo.

NCT05208944,NCT05208944_chunk_0,"Title: THIO Sequenced with Cemiplimab in Advanced NSCLC Brief Summary: THIO is a first-in-class small molecule telomere targeting agent, in development for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with cemiplimab (LIBTAYO®). THIO is preferentially incorporated into telomeres sequence in telomerase-positive cells leading to rapid telomere uncapping, genomic instability, and cell death. Cemiplimab is a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor recently approved as a first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 50% or more PD-L1 expression. It is hypothesized that THIO administration prior to cemiplimab would restore tumor responses to immunotherapy in subjects who either developed resistance or relapsed after receiving first line treatment with an immune check point inhibitor.

Randomization sequences will be in random block sizes and stratified for ENCALS risk category \[high risk ≥ -4.5 vs. low risk \< -4.5\], and for background ALS treatment (riluzole and/or edaravone and/or sodium phenylbutyrate and/or taurursodiol) vs. no background ALS treatment. All subjects will be administered the drug/placebo twice daily (BID), two tablets each time, for 6 months.

BB-301 will be injected directly into the middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle of the throat through the use of an open surgical procedure conducted under general anesthesia. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of BB-301, to identify the best dose of BB-301 to administer to patients, and to characterize how well BB-301 works to improve the symptoms of dysphagia in patients with OPMD.

The PCR is a pixel-based measure made on lateral view videofluoroscopy swallow study frames. The PCR is calculated by tracing the unobliterated area of the pharynx (including the bolus) at the point of maximum constriction during the swallow and then dividing that area by a corresponding area measure when the pharynx is at rest. Maximum constriction is measured during a 20 cc swallow of liquid barium, and the pharyngeal area at rest is measured with a 1 mL bolus being held in the mouth prior to swallow initiation., Baseline, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270, Day 360|Phase 1b: Maximum pharyngeal dilation as estimated by %(C2-4)^2-normalized post-swallow hyoid rest pharyngeal area (HRAN), Maximum pharyngeal dilation will be estimated by HRAN.

The IDDSI framework consists of a continuum of 8 levels (0-7), where drinks are measured from Levels 0-4, while foods are measured from Levels 3-7. The IDDSI framework provides a common terminology to describe food textures and drink thickness.

The PCR is a pixel-based measure made on lateral view videofluoroscopy swallow study frames. The PCR is calculated by tracing the unobliterated area of the pharynx (including the bolus) at the point of maximum constriction during the swallow and then dividing that area by a corresponding area measure when the pharynx is at rest. Maximum constriction is measured during a 20 cc swallow of liquid barium, and the pharyngeal area at rest is measured with a 1 mL bolus being held in the mouth prior to swallow initiation., Baseline, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270, Day 360|Phase 2a: Maximum pharyngeal dilation as estimated by HRAN, Maximum pharyngeal dilation will be estimated by HRAN.

The IDDSI framework consists of a continuum of 8 levels (0-7), where drinks are measured from Levels 0-4, while foods are measured from Levels 3-7. The IDDSI framework provides a common terminology to describe food textures and drink thickness. Lower scores reflect diet texture restrictions to thin liquids., Baseline, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270, Day 360 Sponsor: Benitec Biopharma, Inc.

NCT06255782,NCT06255782_chunk_0,"Title: An Open-label Study to Investigate ECUR-506 in Male Babies Less Than 9 Months of Age With Neonatal Onset OTC Deficiency (OTC-HOPE) Brief Summary: Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, the most common urea cycle disorder, is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a genetic defect in a liver enzyme responsible for detoxification of ammonia. Individuals with OTC deficiency can build-up excess levels of ammonia in their blood, potentially resulting in devastating consequences, including cumulative and irreversible neurological damage, coma and death. The severe form of the condition emerges shortly after birth and is more common in boys than girls. This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, safety and dose finding study of ECUR-506 in male babies with neonatal onset OTC deficiency. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple dose levels of ECUR-506 following intravenous (IV) administration of a single dose.

NCT05579249,NCT05579249_chunk_0,"Title: A Research Study Comparing Wegovy to Other Weight Management Drugs in People Living With Obesity in America Brief Summary: The purpose of this post approval pragmatic clinical study is to see how well semaglutide lowers body weight compared to other medication on the market used to treat obesity, across three US-based employers. These employers represent employees of diverse demography and job functions including hospitality, clerical, administrative, housekeeping, maintenance, and specialised employees across a range of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. The study will also look at how weight loss affects physical functioning, quality of life and ability to work.

However these treatments are short term and therefore patients require regular treatments in order to manage the condition. Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective treatments which provide longer term benefits. The aim of SerpinPC is to prevent bleeding rather than to have to treat bleeds to minimise pain and damage after they have occurred.

NCT04469595,NCT04469595_chunk_0,"Title: A Study of Intravitreal ILUVIEN® Implant as Baseline Therapy in Patients With Early Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Brief Summary: This is a randomized, masked, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study that will assess the efficacy of ILUVIEN as a baseline therapy in the treatment of Center Involving DME (CI-DME). The study will enroll patients who are either treatment naïve or have not received any DME treatments for the preceding 12 months as documented in medical records.
