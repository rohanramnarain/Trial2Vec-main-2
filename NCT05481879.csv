NCT05481879,"Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamic, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetic Study of DYNE-101 in Participants With Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05481879,ACHIEVE,RECRUITING,"The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple intravenous (IV) doses of DYNE-101 administered to participants with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1).

The study consists of 4 periods: A Screening Period (up to 8 weeks), a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) Placebo-Controlled Period (24 weeks), a Treatment Period (24 weeks) and a Long-Term Extension (LTE) Period (96 weeks).",NO,Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1),DRUG: DYNE-101|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Through study completion, up to Week 145","Change From Baseline in Splicing Index in Skeletal Muscle Tissue, Baseline up to Week 45|Change From Baseline in Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Expression in Muscle Tissue, Baseline up to Week 45|Change From Baseline in Hand Grip Relaxation Time, Baseline up to Week 145|Change From Baseline in Myotonia as Measured by Video Hand Opening Time (vHOT), Baseline up to Week 145|Change From Baseline in Quantitative Myometry Testing (QMT), Baseline up to Week 145|Change From Baseline in 10-Meter Walk/Run Test (10-MWRT), Baseline up to Week 145|Change From Baseline in Stair-Ascend/Descend Test, Baseline up to Week 145|Change From Baseline in 5 Times Sit to Stand (5×STS), Baseline up to Week 145|Change From Baseline in 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), Baseline up to Week 145|Maximum Observed Plasma Drug Concentration (Cmax) of DYNE-101, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (tmax) of DYNE-101, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Hour 0 to the Last Measurable Plasma Concentration (AUCtlast) of DYNE-101, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC∞) of DYNE-101 in Plasma, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Apparent Terminal Elimination Rate Constant (λz) of DYNE-101 in Plasma, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Apparent Terminal Elimination Half-Life (t½) of DYNE-101 in Plasma, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Clearance (CL) of DYNE-101 in Plasma, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of DYNE-101 in Plasma, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Volume of Distribution at the Terminal Phase (Vz) of DYNE-101 in Plasma, Pre-dose, and at multiple timepoints up to Week 145|Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) Concentration of DYNE-101 in Muscle Tissue, Up to Week 45|Percentage of Participants With Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs), Up to Week 145",,Dyne Therapeutics,,ALL,ADULT,PHASE1|PHASE2,104,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",DYNE101-DM1-201|2022-000889-18,2022-09-05,2026-07,2026-07,2022-08-01,,2024-10-31,"Institut de Myologie, Paris, 75013, France|Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich - Friedrich Baur Institut, Munich, 80336, Germany|Centro Clinico Nemo, Milan, 20162, Italy|Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A Gemelli-Rome, Rome, 00168, Italy|Radboud Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands|NZCR Auckland, Auckland, 1023, New Zealand|University College London Hospitals, London, NW1 2BU, United Kingdom|John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, United Kingdom|Salford Royal Hospital, Salford, M6 8HD, United Kingdom",
