NCT06079736,A Study Of PGN-EDO51 In Participants With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Amenable To Exon 51-Skipping Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06079736,CONNECT1-EDO51,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The study consists of 3 periods: A Screening Period (up to 45 days), a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Period (16 weeks), and a Long-Term Extension (LTE) Period (108 weeks).

The primary purpose of the MAD period is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending intravenous (IV) doses of PGN-EDO51 administered to participants with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The primary purpose of the LTE period is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of PGN-EDO51 in participants who have completed the MAD period.",NO,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,DRUG: PGN-EDO51,"Adverse events and serious adverse events (safety and tolerability of PGN-EDO51 in MAD period), Adverse events and serious adverse events, Baseline to Week 16|Adverse events and serious adverse events (long-term safety and tolerability of PGN-EDO51 in LTE period), Adverse events and serious adverse events, Baseline to Week 108","Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (MAD period), Maximum observed plasma concentration of PGN-EDO51, Baseline to Week 12|Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (MAD period), Time to maximum observed plasma concentration of PGN-EDO51, Baseline to Week 12|Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (MAD period), Apparent terminal half-life of PGN-EDO51, Baseline to Week 12|Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (MAD period), Area under the curve for concentration time of PGN-EDO51, Baseline to Week 12|PK Plasma levels (LTE period), PK sampling for PGN-EDO51 and PGN-PMO51 plasma levels, Baseline to Week 104|Skeletal muscle concentration of PGN-EDO51 (MAD period), Change from baseline in skeletal muscle concentration of PGN-EDO51 after multiple doses, Baseline to Week 16|Dystrophin Levels (MAD period), Change from baseline in dystrophin levels measured after multiple doses, Baseline to Week 16",,PepGen Inc,,MALE,CHILD,PHASE2,7,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,PGN-EDO51-102,2024-01-08,2025-04,2027-04,2023-10-12,,2025-03-04,"British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6H1G9, Canada|Stan Cassidy Centre for Rehabilitation, Fredericton, New Brunswick, E3B0C7, Canada|Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, Ontario, K1H8L1, Canada|The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto, Ontario, M5G0A4, Canada|CHU de Québec, Québec, Quebec, G1V4G2, Canada",
