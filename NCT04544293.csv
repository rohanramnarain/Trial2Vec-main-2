NCT04544293,Clinical Trial of Inhaled Molgramostim Nebulizer Solution in Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (aPAP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04544293,IMPALA-2,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,160 subjects with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) will be randomized to receive once daily treatment with inhaled molgramostim or placebo for 48 weeks. Subjects completing the 48 week placebo-controlled period will receive open-label treatment with once daily inhaled molgramostim for 96 weeks.,NO,Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis,DRUG: Molgramostim|DRUG: Placebo,"Change from baseline in percentage (%) predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) to Week 24, As a measure of pulmonary gas exchange, a standardized lung function test, DLCO, will be conducted. The single-breath DLCO test will be performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines for DLCO testing., From Baseline to Week 24","Change from baseline in percentage (%) predicted DLCO to Week 48, As a measure of pulmonary gas exchange, a standardized lung function test, DLCO, will be conducted. The single-breath DLCO test will be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines for DLCO testing., From Baseline to Week 48|Change from baseline in St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total score to Week 24, The SGRQ includes questions related to three components: Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), Impact (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease), and Symptoms (respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity). The questionnaire has a recall period of 4 weeks for Symptoms, whereas Activity and Impact components address the subject's current state. The subjects will be asked to grade their current health on a 5-point scale (very poor, poor, fair, good, or very good)., From Baseline to Week 24|Change from baseline in SGRQ Activity component score to Week 24, The SGRQ includes questions related to three components: Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), Impact (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease), and Symptoms (respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity). The questionnaire has a recall period of 4 weeks for Symptoms, whereas Activity and Impact components address the subject's current state. The subjects will be asked to grade their current health on a 5-point scale (very poor, poor, fair, good, or very good)., Week 24|Change from baseline in exercise capacity (EC), expressed as peak metabolic equivalents (METs) to Week 24, As a functional measure of exertional limitations related to dyspnea, EC will be assessed by an exercise treadmill test. EC will be expressed in peak METs (1 MET=3.5 mL O2/kg/min). The highest treadmill speed and grade achieved will be used to calculate peak METs., From Baseline to Week 24|Change from baseline in SGRQ Total score to Week 48, The SGRQ includes questions related to three components: Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), Impact (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease), and Symptoms (respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity). The questionnaire has a recall period of 4 weeks for Symptoms, whereas Activity and Impact components address the subject's current state. The subjects will be asked to grade their current health on a 5-point scale (very poor, poor, fair, good, or very good)., Week 48|Change from baseline in SGRQ Activity from baseline to Week 48, The SGRQ includes questions related to three components: Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), Impact (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease), and Symptoms (respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity).

EC will be expressed in peak METs (1 MET=3.5 mL O2/kg/min). The highest treadmill speed and grade achieved will be used to calculate peak METs., From Baseline to Week 48|Change from baseline in alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2) to Week 24 (Specifically for Japan and South Korea), A-aDO2 will be used as an additional measure of gas exchange., From Baseline to Week 24|Number of subjects with serious and non-serious adverse events, Assessment of the safety of MOL compared to placebo, From screening (6-week) until Follow-up visit (Week 100)|Number of subjects with positive treatment-boosted anti Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody titers during 24 weeks' treatment and during 48 weeks' treatment, Assessment of the safety of MOL compared to placebo, From screening (6-week) until Follow-up visit (Week 100)|Changes in Forced vital capacity (FVC), Assessment of the safety of MOL compared to placebo, From Baseline to Weeks 24 and 48|Changes in Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), Assessment of the safety of MOL compared to placebo, From Baseline to Weeks 24 and 48|Change in QT interval corrected by Fridericia (QTcF), Assessment of the safety of MOL compared to placebo, From Baseline to Weeks 4 and 24",,Savara Inc.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,160,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",SAV006-05|2020-001263-85,2021-05-10,2023-11-30,2024-11-30,2020-09-10,,2024-10-31,"University Of Arkansas For Medical Services, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205, United States|UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado, 80206, United States|Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, United States|University of Florida Health, Gainesville, Florida, 32610, United States|Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30322, United States|Loyola University, Maywood, Illinois, 60153, United States|University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201, United States|Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, 27710, United States|Wake Med Health & Hospital, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27610, United States|Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45229-3039, United States|Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195, United States|University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine -
