NCT06955091,Effects of Contrast Strength Training in Badminton Players,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06955091,,COMPLETED,"Badminton is one of the most popular sports worldwide. In general, badminton jumping actions have two goals: achieve maximum height and reach a precise location using certain body movements. Both objectives are important in badminton and must be considered when conducting practical training sessions and imparting techniques. The players should have agility to move on the court forward sideward and backward to do many actions with high speed. They require sports specific training to achieve power, stability and agility in the ground for a powerful performance. Contrast strength training is multi-intervention programs and it has a certain influence on agility, power and speed.A sample size of 48 badminton players from Pakistan Sports Board, university level and badminton club players will be taken through Non-Probability Convenience Sampling technique. Sample size of players with age group between 17-28 years will be taken. Players will be selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be equally divided into two groups by random number generator table. Group A experimental group will perform contrast strength training. Group B participants of the control group will follow their standard badminton practice over the same duration with no strength training design. Before and after completion of the respective training agility and power will be assessed through t-test and vertical jump test. For explosive speed 40-yard dash will be performed.

Although Taipei has implemented dispatch-assisted CPR, delays remain between arrest recognition and AED application due to manpower and policy limitations. International guidelines, including the Global Resuscitation Alliance's ten steps to improve OHCA outcomes, recommend involving police as first responders. Prior studies from the United States and Switzerland demonstrate that police often arrive before emergency medical services (EMS), underscoring their potential role in reducing response times. However, police have not been officially included in OHCA dispatch systems in any region of Taiwan. This study aims to evaluate the willingness of police officers in New Taipei City to participate in prehospital resuscitation through a structured questionnaire.

NCT06953427,The Impact of Age on Short-term Post-thrombectomy Outcomes in Patients Aged 70 or Beyond With Acute Ischemic Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06953427,,COMPLETED,"A recent Cochrane systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing endovascular intervention-either mechanical thrombectomy or intra-arterial thrombolysis combined with medical treatment-to conservative medical treatment alone provided high-certainty evidence that endovascular intervention increases the likelihood of achieving a favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale \[mRS\] score of 0-2) by 50% in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).1 More recently, a cross-Atlantic RCT was conducted to determine whether endovascular therapy (EVT) plus medical care is superior to medical care alone in patients with acute proximal cerebral vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and large infarcts, regardless of infarct size. The study confirmed a 63% increased odds of a favorable outcome with EVT plus medical care. In real-world registries of EVT for AIS due to large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, approximately one-half of patients are aged 70 and older, while 13% to 39% are aged 80 and beyond. In patients aged 70 and beyond who are EVT-eligible, post-procedure mortality increases progressively with increasing age. A prospective European study found that each additional year of age was associated with an 8% decline in the likelihood of achieving a favorable functional outcome. In elderly patients, increasing age is more than just a number-it reflects a higher likelihood of significant medical comorbidities, polypharmacy, declining functional status, compromised nutritional status, and weakened immune function. Research on age as a predictor of EVT outcomes often compares elderly patients to much younger counterparts. However, contrasting post-EVT outcomes in older adults with those under 70 is neither realistic nor appropriate due to inherent differences in baseline health, comorbidities, and physiological resilience. Therefore, the investigators analyzed a prospectively registered cohort to assess whether age influences post-EVT functional outcomes, using septuagenarians as the control group.",NO,Acute Cerebral Ischemia|Endovascular Thrombectomy|Prognosis|Age Factors|Interventional Radiology|Elderly (Aged &gt;70),,"Post-endovascular thrombectomy modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) reperfusion grade, Modified Treatment In Cerebral Ischemia (TICI) scale:

NCT06948240,AF Coronary Embolism Long Term Outcomes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06948240,,COMPLETED,"Introduction Coronary embolism (CE) is a relatively rare but significant cause of non-atherosclerotic acute myocardial infarction (AMI), representing about 3% of all AMI cases, though it is likely underdiagnosed. CE is associated with worse clinical outcomes than traditional atherosclerotic AMI, showing increased rates of cardiac death and cerebrovascular events. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the primary underlying cause of CE, cited in 28%-73% of cases across large series. Despite AF's central role, comprehensive data detailing the clinical, biochemical, echocardiographic, angiographic characteristics, and outcomes of CE specifically linked to AF remains limited. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by retrospectively evaluating patients with AF-related CE (AF CE) and non-AF CE, characterizing their differences and identifying outcome predictors.

Methods From January 2008 to Dicember 2024, consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary care cardiology unit and meeting both the Fourth Universal Definition of AMI and either definite or probable CE per Shibata's criteria were retrospectively included. Shibata's classification involves major and minor angiographic and clinical criteria to establish the likelihood of CE. Definite CE is diagnosed with a combination of major and minor criteria, while probable CE requires fewer criteria. Cases with evidence of atherosclerotic thrombus, prior revascularization, coronary anomalies like ectasia, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or stress cardiomyopathy were excluded.

Coronary Embolism Definition

The Shibata criteria define CE based on:

Major criteria: angiographic embolism signs unrelated to atherosclerosis, multisite CE, systemic embolism excluding left ventricular thrombus from STEMI.

Minor criteria: non-significant coronary stenosis (\<25%), embolic source identified by imaging, and risk factors like AF, dilated cardiomyopathy, rheumatic valve disease, prosthetic valves, recent cardiac surgery, coagulation disorders, patent foramen ovale, or atrial septal defect.

Coronary Arteriography All patients underwent invasive coronary angiography, independently reviewed by two specialists. Stenoses were visually assessed according to recognized grading systems.

Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography was performed following contemporary guidelines, evaluating left atrial and ventricular size and function, and left atrial strain using speckle tracking with standardized software (Philips).

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) CMR was performed in patients initially diagnosed with MINOCA (Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries) based on standard protocols, evaluating for subendocardial or transmural late gadolinium enhancement and focal myocardial edema to support CE diagnosis.

Atrial Fibrillation Definition AF was diagnosed as per ESC guidelines, requiring over 30 seconds of rhythm without P waves and irregular RR intervals. Both history of AF and new-onset AF during hospitalization or follow-up qualified for classification into the AF CE group.

Outcomes

Two types of outcomes were evaluated:

In-hospital outcomes: composite of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, or death.

Long-term outcomes: composite of reinfarction, systemic embolism, stroke, cardiac or all-cause mortality.

Ethics The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee, with a waiver of informed consent, justified under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (reference n° 3318-0000257).

Statistical Analysis Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, continuous variables as means ± standard deviations. AF CE and non-AF CE groups were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for qualitative variables, and parametric or non-parametric tests for quantitative variables depending on distribution normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). For in-hospital outcomes, univariable logistic regression was performed to identify associated variables, followed by multivariable stepwise forward logistic regression for variables with p \< 0.1. Long-term outcomes were assessed using univariable Cox regression and multivariable stepwise forward Cox regression for significant variables. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and log-rank tests evaluated long-term outcome differences.

NCT06949332,Investigation of the Instant Effect of Rocabado Exercise,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06949332,,COMPLETED,"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw joint is a bilateral hinge joint formed by the fusion of the temporal bone and mandible, which provides complex movements necessary for basic functions such as eating, swallowing, speaking and yawning. This joint, which can perform rotation and translation movements, functions with the coordinated work of the masticatory muscles (masseter, temporalis, pterygoideus medialis and lateralis, digastricus). The masseter muscle in particular plays an important role in closing the jaw and generating chewing force.

Rocabado exercises are a special exercise program that requires the active participation of the patient to restore the normal movement of the TMJ, reduce pain, maintain body balance and correct postural disorders. This program includes six different exercises: tongue relaxation position, shoulder retraction, head position stabilization, chin tuck, TMJ rotation control and rhythmic stabilization technique.

There are a limited number of studies on the effectiveness of Rocabado exercises in the literature and there is no study specifically examining the effects of these exercises on the masseter muscle. Therefore, this study will investigate the effects of Rocabado exercises on masseter muscle activity in sedentary individuals.

Physiological dead space refers to the portion of air that is ventilated but does not participate in gas exchange due to impaired perfusion or ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Traditionally, dead space is calculated using the end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO₂) method, which estimates the difference between arterial and exhaled CO₂ values. However, this method may be influenced by circulatory failure or abnormal CO₂ distribution. An alternative method using the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient \[P(A-a)O₂\] has been proposed, as it may provide a more stable measurement under critical conditions by relying on oxygenation efficiency rather than CO₂ elimination.

In this prospective observational study, patients receiving mechanical ventilation in a tertiary ICU will be monitored. Physiological dead space will be calculated using both the EtCO₂-based method and the P(A-a)O₂-based method. Various respiratory and clinical parameters, including arterial blood gases, ventilator settings, and severity scores, will be recorded. The correlation between the two methods will be assessed, and their relationship with ICU mortality will be analyzed.

NCT06933485,Posture and Prevention: Evaluating an Exercise Program for Dental Students,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06933485,Evaluation,COMPLETED,"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are recognized as a growing global public health concern, encompassing a range of inflammatory and degenerative conditions that affect the muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, bones, and joints. These disorders are commonly linked to repetitive strain, poor posture, and cumulative trauma resulting from non-ergonomic work environments. Dental professionals, particularly due to their constrained workspaces, prolonged procedures, and repetitive tasks, are among the most affected healthcare providers.

Numerous studies reveal that between 64% and 93% of dentists suffer from MSDs during their professional lives, with significant consequences including chronic pain, physical limitations, reduced productivity, and decreased quality of life. The root of the problem often begins during dental education, where students are first exposed to the physical demands of clinical practice without adequate ergonomic training. Dental education, unlike many other academic disciplines, combines theoretical and hands-on clinical learning from early years. Students are subjected to high physical strain, repetitive manual procedures, and poor working postures, particularly when clinical experience and ergonomic awareness are lacking.

Despite growing awareness of this issue, recent findings at Akdeniz University Faculty of Dentistry underscore the severity and prevalence of MSDs among students. A 2022 study, conducted within the framework of the ""Ergonomics and Stretching Movements in Dentistry"" course, showed that 90.8% of fourth- and fifth-year dental interns experienced MSD symptoms within the past year. The most commonly affected regions included the neck (80.9%), back (71.7%), lower back (69.1%), and shoulders (65%). Alarmingly, only 21.7% of these students reported engaging in regular physical activity, while a substantial 85.5% expressed interest in receiving education on preventive exercises and stretching techniques tailored to dental practice.

These findings highlight the critical need for early intervention in dental education to promote musculoskeletal health. The physical demands of dentistry, including static and asymmetrical postures, prolonged standing or sitting, and repetitive forceful movements, contribute to muscular fatigue and postural imbalances. Even when dentists maintain ideal working positions, over 50% of their muscles remain in a state of contraction to counteract gravitational forces, leading to long-term strain and discomfort.

In this context, structured physical activity-particularly posture-oriented stretching and strengthening exercises-emerges as an effective, low-cost, and easily applicable solution. Scientific studies have shown that regular stretching increases synovial fluid production for joint lubrication, improves circulation, reduces pain from trigger points, and relaxes overactive muscles. Moreover, short stretching sessions during clinical work have proven effective in decreasing MSD-related symptoms in dental professionals.

Drawing from these insights, our project proposes the implementation of a Posture-Oriented Exercise Program for dental students at Akdeniz University, developed under the guidance of an experienced physiotherapist. The initiative is supported by the Özlenen Student Scientific Research Project and also aims to function as a social responsibility project. The main goal is to raise awareness of the importance of physical activity in maintaining professional health, and to evaluate the benefits of a targeted exercise routine in preventing MSDs.

The proposed program will be integrated into the students' routine under supervision, focusing on practical and evidence-based stretching and posture-correction exercises. Through systematic monitoring, we aim to assess changes in posture, reduction in pain symptoms, and the students' overall ergonomic awareness. By instilling healthy habits and musculoskeletal care strategies during their formative years, this project aims to empower future dentists with tools to sustain long-term occupational health and well-being.

Ultimately, the findings of this project could serve as a model for incorporating ergonomics and physical activity education into dental curriculums more broadly, not only addressing an urgent health concern but also contributing to the sustainability and effectiveness of the dental profession in the long term.",NO,Postural Instability|Dentistry|Muskuloskeletal Problems,OTHER: Exercise,"Quality Of Life Questionnaire, The study uses the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire to collect information about the participant's health-related quality of life (QOL).

NCT06916559,Comparison of Different Methods for Measuring Urinary Oxalate and Citrate: An Observational Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06916559,Comparison of,COMPLETED,"This observational study aims to compare three different laboratory methods for measuring urine oxalate and citrate concentrations. The primary objective is to evaluate whether an improved High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method-using a novel derivatization reagent-can achieve similar accuracy to the gold standard Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) while offering advantages in cost, speed, and ease of use in routine clinical settings.

The study will involve the collection of morning urine samples from both healthy volunteers and patients with urolithiasis (urinary stones). Each urine sample will be tested using the following three methods:

1. Modified High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): This method builds on traditional HPLC technology by incorporating a novel derivatization reagent to enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of detecting oxalate and citrate. The improved HPLC method is designed to be less time-consuming and more cost-effective, which could make it a viable option for regular clinical use.
2. Ion Chromatography (IC): Widely used in many hospital laboratories, the IC method detects urine oxalate and citrate without the need for a derivatization step. While this method is straightforward and convenient, its sensitivity and accuracy are expected to be lower compared to LC-MS/MS and the modified HPLC method.
3. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS): LC-MS/MS is currently considered the gold standard for measuring urine oxalate and citrate due to its high sensitivity and specificity. However, the method requires expensive equipment and involves complex procedures, limiting its routine application in most clinical laboratories.

Participants will provide urine samples, which will be divided and analyzed using all three methods simultaneously. The study will assess the correlation and consistency between the methods, with a particular focus on comparing the modified HPLC method to LC-MS/MS. Statistical analyses, including Bland-Altman analysis and linear regression, will be used to determine the agreement between the measurement techniques.

This study is non-interventional and involves only the collection of urine samples, posing minimal risk to participants. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants after they are fully briefed about the study objectives, procedures, and any potential risks. All collected data will be managed confidentially and analyzed rigorously to ensure the reliability of the findings.

If the modified HPLC method demonstrates comparable accuracy to LC-MS/MS, it could provide a more accessible, cost-effective, and timely option for routine clinical measurement of urinary oxalate and citrate.

NCT06892327,BIOmetric MEasurements in Diagnostics: Comparison of EXperts and IA-assisted Residents,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06892327,BIOMEDEXIA,COMPLETED,"Obstetric ultrasound is the cornerstone of fetal growth assessment. It provides essential biometric measurements for estimating fetal weight, monitoring growth and identifying conditions such as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) or macrosomia. The accuracy of these measurements depends largely on the expertise of the operator. Experienced practitioners excel at positioning the probe, identifying anatomical landmarks and obtaining reproducible measurements. In contrast, novice operators, such as medical residents, may find it difficult to capture optimal images or identify precise landmarks, resulting in significant variability. This inter-observer variability, well documented even among experts, can have an impact on clinical decisions and obstetric management. For novices, variability is more pronounced, which can affect diagnostic reliability and patient care. Improving resident training is therefore essential to reduce this variability. Traditional solutions to minimizing variability, such as increased supervision, face limitations due to time constraints and resource availability. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) could help in the training of residents. In obstetrics, AI could potentially automate biometric measurements by identifying key anatomical landmarks and performing precise, consistent measurements. These systems might standardize acquisition and reduce variability, making measurements less dependent on operator experience. AI technologies could significantly improve novice performance by potentially shortening the learning curve and enhancing measurement reliability. This might enable residents to work more independently while maintaining accuracy. Despite these potential advantages, few studies would have rigorously compared AI-assisted novice performance with that of expert practitioners under real-world conditions.This study aims to assess the possible effectiveness of AI in supporting novice operators during obstetric biometric measurements. The primary objective would be to determine whether AI assistance could enable novices to achieve measurement accuracy comparable to that of experienced practitioners, while potentially improving reproducibility and reducing inter-observer variability.",NO,Pregnancy,OTHER: standard biometric ultrasound,"Accuracy of biometric measurements: Assessment of agreement between manual and AI-assisted measurements., The individual biometric measurements, such as biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL), will be presented separately based on their respective units (cm).

Children, who are more fragile than adults, usually require additional care support during the treatment process. Labour force statistics have determined that one third of the loss of labour force occurs after musculoskeletal injuries.

When the literature is examined, there are many studies investigating loss of labour force after fractures. It was found that 20% of the patients never returned to work after distal radius fracture and the average loss of labour force was 9.2 weeks.

Procedure:

Patient Position: The pregnant woman is placed comfortably in a supine position. The abdominal area is exposed to allow easy movement of the probe.

Equipment: A Doppler ultrasonography device (e.g., Voluson E8, GE Healthcare) and an abdominal probe with an appropriate frequency are used.

NCT06853548,Core Stability and Respiratory Parameters in Children With Thoracic Hyperkyphosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06853548,,COMPLETED,"Hyperkyphosis, defined as an excessive curvature of the thoracic spine beyond normal limits, is among the factors that reduce chest wall mobility and lung function. In modern society, increased sitting durations contribute to increased thoracic kyphosis. Studies have indicated that an increase in thoracic kyphosis and a decrease in thoracic spinal mobility are associated with reduced respiratory functions, such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).

The diaphragm forms the upper part of the core stability system. When contracted, it increases intra-abdominal pressure, contributing to core stability. The diaphragm also contracts in advance of and during limb movements to assist in postural control. Additionally, the diaphragm is the primary respiratory muscle responsible for inspiration. Any functional loss in the diaphragm, which alone accounts for 65-80% of vital capacity, can significantly reduce inspiratory capacity. During forced expiration, muscles such as the rectus abdominis, transversus abdominis, internal obliques, and external obliques play an active role. Specifically, the transversus abdominis, like the diaphragm, increases intra-abdominal pressure and supports trunk stabilization. However, the relationship between respiratory muscle strength and the endurance of core stability muscles remains unclear.

NCT06846242,Validity and Reliability of the Scapular Muscular Endurance Test,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06846242,,COMPLETED,"The scapula plays a crucial role in proper shoulder function, contributing to synchronized scapular rotation during humeral motion, serving as a stable base for rotator cuff activation, and acting as a key link in the kinetic chain. Each of these functions is essential for optimal arm movement and depends on the integrity of the surrounding shoulder anatomy. However, bone and soft tissue damage, as well as muscle weakness and shortening, can alter the scapula's roles, affecting both its resting position and dynamic motion. This altered scapular position and/or motion is referred to as scapular dyskinesia.

Although scapular dyskinesia is commonly observed in shoulder injuries, it is generally considered a nonspecific response to shoulder pain rather than a direct consequence of a specific glenohumeral pathology. Therefore, assessing the presence or absence of scapular dyskinesia is a critical component of clinical evaluation. A comprehensive assessment should include a visual examination of the scapula at rest and during dynamic humeral movements, as well as objective measurements of posture and the performance of scapular corrective maneuvers. These evaluations assist clinicians in determining the extent to which scapular involvement contributes to a given shoulder injury.

The treatment of scapular dyskinesia should begin with optimizing anatomical alignment, followed by restoring dynamic scapular stability through the strengthening of scapular stabilizers using kinetic chain-based rehabilitation protocols. The kinetic chain, as defined by Steindler, is ""a combination of successive joints containing complex motor units."" It describes the interconnected movement of joints, where adjacent segments interact to form a continuous chain of motion. This biomechanical model emphasizes that dysfunction in any part of the chain can impact movement quality in both upper and lower segments. The scapula is a foundational component within this system, with surrounding muscles playing a crucial role in stabilizing it.

Postural disorders such as kyphosis can lead to scapular deformities, negatively affecting scapular stability. Rehabilitation professionals and researchers increasingly use the Scapular Muscular Endurance Test (SMET) to assess scapular stability. Given that adolescents are at a heightened risk for musculoskeletal injuries, upper extremity assessments like the SKET may contribute significantly to evaluating this population. However, the validity and reliability of the SMET in adolescents have yet to be established.

NCT06818045,Nonsurgical Periodontal Treatment Combined With Anti-TNF-α in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis and Periodontitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06818045,,COMPLETED,"Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease of the periodontium that can lead to destruction of the alveolar bone and supporting connective tissue and subsequent tooth loss. Recent studies have shown that periodontitis is associated with age, smoking habits, genetic predisposition, socioeconomic status, and various systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, obesity, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that primarily affects the joints. Periodontitis and RA have similar clinical and pathogenic features. Clinically, both diseases are characterized by local destruction of hard and soft tissues. Their pathogenesis involves the release of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from inflammatory cells. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) leads to the release of high levels of inflammatory mediators that cause bone destruction and the spread of inflammation. TNF-α is the main regulatory cytokine in both RA and periodontitis. TNF-α inhibitors (anti-TNF-α) reduce the number of inflammatory cells, osteoclast formation and bone loss. In addition, many immunological processes have been identified that are similar to both diseases. Autoreactive T cells, natural killer cells, heat shock proteins, autoantibodies and genetic factors are reported to play an important role in the inflammatory pathway of RA and periodontitis.

Recently, TNF-α blocking agents (anti-TNF-α) have been developed and used for the treatment of RA. Animal and human studies have suggested that anti-TNF-α treatment may reduce the severity of periodontitis.

NCT06765889,Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Stress Reduction in Adult Singaporeans a Pilot Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06765889,MISRAS,COMPLETED,"This pilot study investigates self-administered mindfulness (SAM) as a stress reduction intervention, serving as a feasibility assessment for a larger multi-site trial. The research addresses gaps in mindfulness literature, particularly timely given that stress profoundly affects individuals' lives, shaping their thoughts, behaviors, and emotional experiences (Aldwin, 2007; Lazarus \& Folkman, 1984), and plays a significant role in conditions like depression and anxiety (Yang et al., 2015).

The study implements a sham meditation control condition, improving upon passive controls that often yield inflated effect sizes (Patterson et al., 2016). The methodology incorporates both subjective measures, addressing limitations noted by Nichols et al. (2008), and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. HRV has proven useful for its sensitivity to stress-induced changes (Goldberger et al., 2001), with higher values indicating better parasympathetic recovery (Shaffer \& Ginsberg, 2017; Michels et al., 2013).

Set in Singapore, where stress management is a significant concern (Chodavadia et al., 2023), the study builds on Kabat-Zinn's (2003, 2006) definition of mindfulness. Unlike traditional programs, these interventions are more accessible (Spijkerman et al., 2016).

Recent meta-analyses show mixed findings: some identified small but significant effects (Cavanagh et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2021), while others found no evidence of effectiveness after accounting for publication bias (Sparacio et al., 2024a). The study considers Singapore's unique cultural position (Li, Ngin, \& Teo, 2007) and utilizes smartphone-based HRV monitoring, supported by research validating PPG technology (Guede-Fernández et al., 2020).

The VAS is a simple, continuous scale that is easy to administer and score. A straight line, usually 10 centimeter (cm) in length, is drawn on a piece of paper or presented on a digital device. The endpoints of the line represent the extremes of pain experienced by participants.The left end of the line is anchored with the phrase ""No Pain"" (0 cm).The right end of the line is anchored with the phrase ""Worst Possible Pain"" (10 cm).Participants are asked to mark a point on the line that they feel represents their current level of pain.Lower scores( between 0 to 3 ) indicate less severe pain, while higher scores (4-10) indicate more severe pain., From enrollment to the third day after surgery|Consumption of opioid medications, The consumption of opioid medications is calculated by translating the number of times a patient activates a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and any additional analgesics prescribed postoperatively into equivalent doses of morphine.This method allows for a standardized assessment of opioid usage across different types of medications and formulations, providing a consistent metric for evaluating pain management strategies and outcomes.

2. To translate and validate a Swedish version of the Risk of Elder Abuse and Mistreatment Instrument (REAMI) that can be used by professional caregivers to estimate risk of maltreatment and abuse of people with dementia.
3. To explore experiences of abuse among people with dementia and their next of kin.

Method People with mild to moderate dementia (n=80) and their next of kin (n=80) are recruited at health and social care facilities providing care to people with dementia. In cases of severe dementia or when the person with dementia is excluded for other reasons, only next of kin is included.

The following steps are used in the data collection

1. Participants fill out the REAGERA-S20 or REAGERA-N individually.
2. Participants are interviewed individually by two different researchers about their abusive experiences. If a participant talks about abusive experiences, a qualitative in-depth interview about those experiences is conducted.
3. A preliminary classification of the participants as abused or not abused, based only on information provided in the individual interview is made.
4. Information provided in the two individual interviews are compared by the researchers. If needed, and with permission obtained individually from the participants, a joint concluding interview is conducted to clarify inconsistencies.
5. A final classification of participants experiences of abuse is made based on the information provided in both interviews.

The validity of the REAGERA-S20/REAGERA-N will be calculated using the following classification of participants made in the interviews as gold standard (aim 1):

For the person with dementia

* Reporting or not reporting abusive experiences during the past 12 months.
* Reporting or not reporting abusive experience earlier in life, i.e. more than 12 months ago.

For the next of kin

* Reporting or not reporting own exposure to abuse by the person with dementia during the past 12 months.
* Reporting or not reporting own perpetration of abuse towards the person with dementia during the past 12 months.
* Reporting or not reporting that the person with dementia has been exposed to abuse by another person during the past 12 months.
* Reporting or not reporting that the person with dementia has been exposed to abuse earlier in life, i.e. more than 12 months ago.

After completion of data collection, the REAMI is filled out by a health or social care professional with knowledge about the participant with dementia. Validity of the instrument will be calculated using the information provided in the interview as the gold standard (aim 2).

NCT06655194,A Study to Learn if There is a Difference in the Blood Levels of Acetylsalicylic Acid When Taken as Different Chewable Tablets on an Empty Stomach by Healthy Participants,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06655194,,COMPLETED,"In this study, researchers want to learn if 2 different forms of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) chewable tablets will have the same effect in the body. For this, they compared the blood levels of a new form of ASA chewable tablet, which is manufactured at a different site, with an approved ASA chewable tablet, on an empty stomach in healthy participants. This is done as part of the regulatory requirement for the marketing approval of the new ASA chewable tablet.

The study treatment, ASA, is an antiplatelet drug. It works by making the blood thinner and stopping the blood from clotting.

In this study, participants will be healthy and will not benefit from taking ASA chewable tablets. However, the study will provide information on how the new ASA chewable tablet, which is manufactured at a different site, has an effect on the body.

The main purpose of this study is to compare blood levels of the new ASA chewable tablet with the approved ASA chewable tablet when taken as a single dose on an empty stomach.

For this, the researchers will analyze:

* Area under the curve (AUC): a measure of the total amount of ASA in participants' blood over time
* Maximum observed concentration (Cmax): the highest amount of ASA in participants' blood after a single dose without food

This study will have 3 treatment periods of 4 days each. In each period, participants will take either the new or approved ASA chewable tablet on an empty stomach according to the order assigned to them. The 2 treatment sequences in this study are:

New chewable tablet, approved chewable tablet, new chewable tablet

Approved chewable tablet, new chewable tablet, approved chewable tablet

Each participant will be in the study for around 7 weeks, which includes:

* a visit within 21 days of the first period to confirm if the participant can take part in the study
* hospital stay of around 2 days in each period, during which, participants will take their assigned treatment, and have blood tests to check for drug levels
* a gap of 1 week after taking the treatment in each period

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* measure the level of the study treatment by taking blood samples
* check participants' health by performing urine tests, checking vital signs and checking heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. The study doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatment.

This is a drug available for doctors to prescribe for patients with Friedrich's Ataxia. But, this drug has not yet been tested in women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding or pumping milk for their babies. So, researchers do not know how much of the drug could be passed on to babies through the breastmilk of mothers who may take BIIB141.

The main objective of this study is to learn how a single dose of BIIB141 is processed in both the breastmilk and in the blood of healthy women who are breastfeeding.

The main question researchers want to answer in this study is:

* How does BIIB141 move from the blood into the breastmilk?

Researchers will also learn more about:

* How BIIB141 moves through the blood
* What dose of BIIB141 a baby may get from the mother's breastmilk
* Any medical problems the participants have during the study

This study will be done as follows:

* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study. The screening period will be up to 28 days, after which participants will check into their study research center.
* Participants will take a single dose of BIIB141 as a tablet by mouth on Day 1.
* Participants will remain at their study research center for 6 days. During this time, the participants will be provided with an electric breast pump. This is so that the researchers can collect breastmilk samples before and after the participants take BIIB141. The researchers will also collect blood samples.

NCT06609616,Feasibility of Measuring Volume of Inspiration Via Noninvasive Motion Sensors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06609616,,COMPLETED,"Background:

Lung problems develop in up to 20% of people after they have surgery. While under general anesthesia, people breathe slower and draw in less air. They may have difficulty returning to normal deep breathing as they recover. Some may develop life-threatening complications. An approved device called an incentive spirometer is used to help measure and improve a person s breathing after surgery. Researchers want to find out if a motion sensor placed on the chest can also measure the volume of air a person inhales as they breathe.

Objective:

To determine if a motion sensor on the chest can measure the volume of air a person breathes.

Eligibility:

Healthy adults aged 18 years and older.

Design:

Participants will have 1 clinic visit. The visit will last 10 to 30 minutes.

They will fill out a form with their age, sex, height, and weight.

A small, plastic motion sensor will be taped to their chest on 1 or both sides.

Participants will breathe through a tube attached to an incentive spirometer. They will take 18 breaths of different volumes, both deep and shallow.

Researchers will use the data collected from the motion sensors to measure how the chest moves at different levels of breathing.

The sample of the study will consist of premature infants who are receiving treatment and care in Izmir Provincial Health Directorate Izmir City Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit within the central borders of Izmir province and who comply with the research limitations to be examined for ROP.

Stage 1: The research will start after the ethics committee and institutional permissions are obtained. The group in which the babies will be included will be determined by randomisation method. In the clinic where the research is carried out, ROP examination is performed on a certain day of the week, so the families of premature babies who meet the inclusion criteria will be informed about the research and their verbal and written permissions will be obtained.

Stage 2: On the day of the examination, fresh breast milk will be obtained from the mothers of the babies in the breast milk group. Mothers of premature infants in the mother voice group will be asked to make a voice recording before the examination. 'Introductory Information Form' will be filled out before the procedure.

Stage 3: Video recording will be made to evaluate the pain, stress, comfort and physiological parameters of premature babies. Video recording will be started 2 minutes before the examination. Video recording will continue for 5 minutes after the ROP examination.

Stage 4: Breast milk odour, mother's voice and physiological parameters of the babies in the control group will be recorded 2 minutes before the examination, 2 minutes after the end of the examination and 5 minutes after the end of the examination.

NCT06535958,Impact of Oral Hygiene Instructions in the Resolution of Peri-implant Mucositis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06535958,,COMPLETED,"Peri-implant mucositis (PM) over dental implants is a highly prevalent disease characterized by inflammation of the peri-implant mucosa without loss of supporting bone around implants. If untreated, PM may progress into peri-implantitis, which may ultimately lead to implant loss. Multiple clinical studies have described a cause-effect relationship between the accumulation of biofilm and the development of PM and therefore effective oral hygiene practices and professional biofilm control are fundamental in their prevention and management. As it was stated in the latest expert consensus on the prevention and treatment of peri-implant diseases, up to date, the treatment of PM includes mechanical professional cleaning associated with oral hygiene instructions (OHI). However, the impact of OHI by itself is not known. This randomized clinical trial over 56 patients aims to identify if there is any superiority of individualized OHI and mechanical/physical instrumentation over OHI alone. The main objective is to evaluate the resolution of the disease, by means of reduction of modified bleeding index (mBI) 1 and 3 months after treatment. Secondary objectives include evaluating microbiological changes and determining if the extent of inflammation measured as the initial mBI could have any impact on PM resolution after different treatment modalities.In addition, the hypotheses formulated are as follows;

* The proper oral hygiene measures conducted by the patient after individualized OHI will achieve resolution of PM in a clinically relevant proportion of patients.
* The proper oral hygiene measures conducted by the patient after individualized OHI will reduce the expression of peri-implant pathogens as much as the combination of individualized OHI and professional mechanical debridement in a clinically relevant proportion of patients.
* The proper oral hygiene measures conducted by the patient after individualized OHI will reduce mBI as much as the combination of individualized OHI and professional mechanical debridement in a clinically relevant proportion of patients.

It is important to note that NLP is not limited to observable behavior. Our way of thinking, that is, all experience and It also includes the mental processes that control our actions. By dealing with the entire structure of a person's experience (in fact, their motivation), it tries to shape the thought processes, emotions and beliefs that result in a behavior.

Studies have been conducted to reduce the anxiety of women undergoing pregnancy termination, but there are no publications on topics such as anxiety, pain perception, and pain catastrophizing.

Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) has been called ""the art and science of personal excellence"", ""the study of subjective experience"". NLP helps us understand the difference between our actions that produce mediocre results or failure and those that require success or excellence.

NLP: ""How do I do something I do well?"", ""How can I do it better?"", ""How can I gain skills that I admire in others? It addresses questions like "". It is important to note that NLP is not limited to observable behavior. Our way of thinking, that is, all experience and it also includes the mental processes that control our actions. By dealing with the entire structure of a person's experience (in fact, their motivation), it tries to shape the thought processes, emotions and beliefs that result in a behavior. It is especially about our communication with ourselves as well as with others.

They mainly affect adolescents and young adults. These pathologies evolve in relapses interspersed with phases of remission. Sometimes associated with extraintestinal manifestations (joint, dermatological, ophthalmological or biliary systems), chronic inflammation of the digestive tract and the resulting symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal syndrome, etc.) lead to a significant alteration in the quality of life of patients in all spheres of activity (professional, sexual, social).

Sleep is a basic neurophysiological state, the normal total duration of which in humans is between six and ten hours per day. It is an essential element of the circadian rhythm in humans, influencing certain cellular functions and in particular the synthesis of cytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules. Sleep disturbances and disruption of the circadian rhythm lead to metabolic and immunological dysfunctions, which may be involved in chronic inflammatory conditions through changes in the immune response.

In the field of IBD, many studies suggest poor sleep quality in patients with IBD. While there seems to be a link between sleep disorders and impaired quality of life with a socio-professional impact in these patients, the links between IBD activity, its treatment and sleep disorders are poorly studied, with discordant results in previous studies.

NCT06365320,Association Between Training Load and Lactate and Other Metabolites Analyzed by Metabolomic and Proteomic Techniques,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06365320,PROTEOMET,COMPLETED,"Physical exercise induces numerous changes in the body in a complex signalling network caused by or in response to increased metabolic activity of contracting skeletal muscles.

The application of omics analytical techniques such as proteomics and metabolomics in the field of sport allows us to understand how the human body responds to exercise and how sports results can be improved by optimising nutrition and training. Both omics techniques offer a quantitative measurement of the metabolic profiles associated with exercise and are able to identify metabolic signatures of athletes from different sports disciplines.

Basketball is a high-intensity exercise modality interspersed with low-intensity. The performance requirements of basketball include aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, with anaerobic metabolism being considered the main energy system. Therefore, basketball players need great athletic ability to produce a successful performance during competition.

For optimal sports performance it is important to adjust the training load, i.e. the degree of effort that the player can withstand in a single training session. Coaches require effective and objective load monitoring tools that allow them to make decisions about training plans based on the needs of each player.

Microsampling systems emerge as an alternative to venipuncture by facilitating self-sampling, which can be carried out outside healthcare centres, in a comfortable and precise way from a small finger prick that the user can perform. These systems are less expensive and can be effective in measuring the levels of glucose metabolism products, such as lactate, through the application of metabolomics and proteomics. On the other hand, the use of non-invasive methods of measuring lactate levels is becoming increasingly popular in sports medicine.

Compared to general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia is preferred to general anaesthesia in the geriatric patient population due to lower postoperative pulmonary complications, reduced frequency of delirium and analgesic requirement, intraoperative haemodynamic stability, early postoperative mobilisation and early discharge.

Central and peripheral regional anaesthesia methods have advantages and disadvantages. This situation causes difficulties in the choice of anaesthesia method. Central regional anaesthesia techniques have more haemodynamic effects and higher frequency of complications compared to peripheral methods. The disadvantages of peripheral methods are that they require ultrasound, block needle, nerve stimulator and require knowledgeable and skilled practitioners.

Effective and fast topical anesthesia of the nasal mucosa is of paramount importance for nasal instrumentation like nasal fiberoptic procedures, awake nasal fiberoptic intubation and placement of nasogastric tubes. Conventional topical anesthesia for the nasal mucosa is often patchy and not always effective. The investigators hypothesize that topical anesthesia of the nasal mucosa with the nasal atomizer adapter (NAA) provides good to excellent nasal topical anesthesia with high patient comfort.

Objective: In this study the NAA will be used for nasal topical anesthesia. The investigators will evaluate complete anesthesia of the nasal mucosa for nasal instrumentation, the use of the NAA and the comfort level for the subjects.

Study design: Interventional study.

Study population: 20 healthy human volunteers, ASA 1, 18-60 years old.

Intervention: Lidocaine 2% will be applied intranasally with the NAA before nasal instrumentation. On completion of the procedure the participant and the researcher will be asked to complete a feedback form.

Winter is a time of particular challenge and is linked to increased absenteeism. There is a growing awareness that probiotics (similar to the bacteria found in yogurts) can play a role in boosting general wellbeing. Probiotics are known as 'good' or 'friendly' bacteria and are living organisms that are found naturally in yogurt and fermented foods. They can be capsules, tablets or powders in sachets that are taken daily to help to keep the gut in peak condition. Everyone has trillions of bacteria in their guts living together happily and they are needed to boost our wellbeing but the stresses and strains of everyday life can often disturb their balance, probiotics can help to restore the balance. Over the winter of 2022, a small exploratory study with employees based in South Wales who were offered the opportunity to 'try out' a probiotic manufactured by Cultech Limited (a company based in Port Talbot specialising in the production of nutritional supplements). The results were very promising with significant improvements in wellbeing and reduced absenteeism among those who opted to take the product.

NCT05947318,Effect of tACS on the Recovery of Motor Control of the Upper Limb and Cerebral Connectivity in Chronic Stroke Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05947318,tACS,COMPLETED,"This project seeks to evaluate the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on the recovery of motor control of the upper limb and associated neuronal synchrony during a 14-sessions (5-week) rehabilitation program for adult patients with diagnosis of stroke at chronic stage. Specifically, the stimulation on Gamma ranges, because the evidence available so far allows us to propose that the tACS in the Gamma range (around 70 Hz) facilitates motor execution.

For this purpose, the experimental approach involves active (70 Hz in Gamma rhythm and 7 Hz, Theta rhythm) and sham tACS together with an analytical and integrated motor training with a double-blind and randomized design.

Our hypothesis is that Gamma frequency tACS restores neuronal synchrony in Beta range, which enhances the upper limb motor recovery associated with a training program.

NCT05741645,Effect of Elastic Taping on Stiffness of Lumbar Stabilizer Muscles,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05741645,,COMPLETED,"Low back pain is a common health problem worldwide. Epidemiological studies have shown that 70-80% of all people are affected at least once in their lifetime.

Although it is common, often the cause of the pain has not been determined and is called 'nonspecific low back pain. Chronic low back pain ranks second among the most common pain complaints under the age of 45 in the industrial age of limited activity. Organic pathology is not encountered in most musculoskeletal system pains. There are usually many underlying causes. The current literature offers a variety of treatment options, depending on the duration and severity of the symptoms of non-specific low back pain. These treatments include behavioral cognitive therapy, medication, electrophysical agents, manual therapy, and general exercises. Looking at the literature, it has been observed that there are not many objective studies investigating the effect of elastic bandage application on muscle elasticity.

When the balance is disturbed (if he leaves while holding his foot, falls from the board, touches the ground with any part of his body, etc.), the time-time is stopped. When the research group regains its balance by climbing on the balance beam, the time continues from where it left off. The test continues in this way for one minute.

NCT05669677,Study to Determine the Response to COVID-19 Vaccination and Prevalence of COVID-19 in Subjects With Chronic Liver Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05669677,,COMPLETED,"Background:

The COVID-19 global pandemic killed more than 6 million people worldwide. Several vaccines have been developed against the virus that causes this disease. These vaccines are effective at preventing severe symptoms and death from COVID-19. Some people with chronic liver disease, especially those with an advanced condition called cirrhosis, do not respond to many vaccines as well as healthy people do. The goal of this natural history study is to find out how well people with chronic liver disease respond to the COVID-19 vaccines.

Objective:

To learn how chronic liver disease affects the body s immune response to vaccination against COVID-19.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years or older with chronic liver disease. They must also be enrolled in protocol 91-DK-0214 or 18-DK-0091.

Design:

Participants will have 3 visits, each spaced 6 months apart. Each visit will last 2 hours.

Participants will have their vital signs recorded. These include age, sex, race, height, and weight. They will give their medical history.

At each visit, participants will have blood drawn through a needle inserted into a vein in the arm. The sample drawn at each visit will be from 1 to 8 tablespoons.

At each visit, participants will fill out a questionnaire. They will answer questions about whether they have been vaccinated against COVID-19; whether they have had COVID-19; and whether they have been exposed to someone who had COVID-19. The questionnaire will take 10 to 15 minutes.

Researchers will also look at results of past blood tests from other research studies.",NO,Chronic or Recovered Hepatitis B|Chronic or Recovered Hepatitis C|Chronic or Recovered Hepatitis D|NAFLD|NASH,,"Prevalence of SARSCOV-2 in subjects with chronic liver disease, To determine the response to SARS-COV-2 vaccination among patients with chronic liver disease stratified by severity (cirrhosis vs no cirrhosis) and compare to healthy controls, ongoing","To determine the durability of antibody against SARS-COV-2 among patients with chronic liver disease., Changes in quantitative levels of SARS-COV-2 antibody over time, ongoing|To determine if SARS-COV-2 seropositivity is associated with reactivation or worsening of chronic hepatitis B., Prevalence of HBV re-activation among patients with and without exposure to SARS-COV-2., ongoing",,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,233,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,10000118|000118-DK,2023-03-15,2025-04-04,2025-04-04,2023-01-03,,2025-04-11,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",
NCT05662566,Risk of Failed Epidural in Patients With and Without Chronic Pain and Opioid Use,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05662566,,COMPLETED,"Patients with chronic pain syndrome (CPS) may develop central sensitization wich may lead to increased pain intensity and lower pain threshold sometimes to the extend of hyperalgesia and allodynia. Furthermore, patients with daily use of opioids may develop opioid tolerance, and to a lesser extent opioid induced hyperalgesia.

These factors may lead to a higher pain intensity in the perioperative setting resulting in the observed increased opioid dosage needed to treat the acute pain. Furthermore opioid titration may be difficult with higher levels of pain and a higher risk of opioid related adverse effects incl. respiratory depression and sedation.

The factors above advocate for utilizing opioid sparing analgesic techniques. In our department as in many others we use an multimodal opioid sparing approach for surgical procedures including epidural anesthesia (EA) as a standard part of the perioperative analgesia strategy after upper laparotomy, as a sufficient epidural anesthesia has shown to provide a stable and often better pain relief than systemic opioids in these patients.

Clinically, there is a suspicion that patients with CPS on fixed opioid treatment have a higher frequency of need for epidural optimization, despite the lack of an anatomical reason for this. One potential explanation could be an altered nociception, requesting another EA strategy than in non-opioid patients.

Purpose and hypothesis This study will explore the frequency of failed EA, defined as EA with insufficient analgesic effect to the extent were replacements of the epidural is needed within the first 5 postoperative days (PODs), testing the hypothesis that failed epidural occurs more frequent in patients with CPS on fixed opioid treatment than in non-opioid patients without CPS.",NO,Chronic Pain|Postoperative Pain|Central Sensitisation,PROCEDURE: Epidural replacement,"Epidural replacement, Number of patients with the need of a new insertion of the epidural catheter, 5 days postoperative","Length of stay at the - post anaesthetic care unit (PACU) / Ward / Hospital, Length of stay at post anaesthetic care unit / the surgical ward / entire admission.

NCT05569395,Effects of Neuromobilization on Median Nerve,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05569395,,COMPLETED,"The median nerve is a mixed nerve with motor and sensory functions in the upper extremity. It is observed that the median nerve slides longitudinally during upper extremity movements. However, in entrapment neuropathies (eg, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome), longitudinal displacement of the nerve is partially limited. In addition, the presence of adhesion, fibrosis, and possible scar tissue may cause difficulties for peripheral nerve adaptation in certain positions and movements. This, in turn, can result in the limitation of nerve trunk movements with respect to the surrounding tissues and a reduction in the normal shift of nerve fibers and fascicles relative to each other and to the connective tissues. Any pathology that reduces the normal stretch and slip of the medial nerve produces abnormal tension during extremity movement and the pressure on the nerve increases. This may cause symptoms such as paresthesia, weakness, and pain in the hand. With neuromobilization exercises, the tension and pressure on the median nerve are reduced and the nerve is prevented from being compressed in the carpal tunnel.

Neuromobilization is part of manual therapy and has been reported to be an effective practice for some conditions, including low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome. The inclusion of neuromobilization in the treatment of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, cervicobrachial pain, and lateral epicondylitis, in particular, has been associated with a reduction in the degree of pain and disability. Recently, neuromobilization techniques have started to be used in the treatment of nerve compression. These techniques consist of a series of therapeutic active and passive movements aimed at restoring the normal mechanical properties of the nerve during limb movements.

When the literature is examined, there are not many studies that objectively reveal the effects of neuromobilization techniques on nerve elasticity. Shear Wave Elastography is a method that quantitatively reveals the elasticity of tissues by measuring the speed of shear waves formed in the tissues through non-invasive high-frequency ultrasound waves. In recent studies, Shear Wave Elastography has shown promising results in demonstrating the elasticity of peripheral nerves.",NO,Median Nerve|Neuromobilization|Stiffness,OTHER: Neuro mobilization|OTHER: Sham neuro mobilization,"Median Nerve Tension Test, The test is performed with the participant in supine position with shoulder depression and 90 degrees abduction and external rotation, elbow 90 degrees flexion, forearm in full supination, and wrist and fingers in full extension.

NCT05466032,Evolution of the Mind-body Connection While Learning About Common Osteopathic Dysfunctions,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05466032,,COMPLETED,"Anecdotally, as first-year medical students learn about common osteopathic dysfunctions, they seem to become more aware of possible dysfunctions in their own bodies. This study will explore whether this new awareness is because of a strengthened mind-body connection, leading to increased proprioceptive awareness, or whether these students are experiencing ""medical student syndrome."" Medical school syndrome is a common phenomenon, especially in the first years of medical school, defined as experiencing ""vague bodily symptoms in terms of the latest disease they have learnt about.""

This study will be conducted in multiple phases throughout 2022- 2023, based around the first year Osteopathic Manual Manipulation (OMM) exam schedule. After study recruitment during orientation week, first year students will be given the baseline participant survey. This survey asks participants to report pain/discomfort in the thoracic, lumbar, or rib/chest areas, as well as what this sensation may be attributed to (ex: somatic dysfunction, muscle soreness, traumatic injury, etc.). After completing the surveys, participants will undergo an osteopathic evaluation to confirm their stated symptoms. Researchers will not be aware of the participants' survey answers for the duration of the data collection portion of the study to reduce unintentional bias during the osteopathic evaluations.

After the first-year students complete each OMM module (thoracic spine, lumbar spine, ribs/chest), they will be given the same survey and osteopathic evaluation. Timing is of particular importance in this study-- conducting the survey and evaluation at a time when students are acutely aware of somatic dysfunctions specific to each region will allow us to link acquisition of this knowledge to the mind-body connection. If a participant reports new or increased pain/discomfort in the region just taught, it is likely to be linked to an increased awareness of the region.

NCT05294913,Enhancing Emotional and Motivational Development to Support Well-being and Retention in Diverse University Students,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05294913,,COMPLETED,"Higher education is crucial for young adults in their intake of knowledge and skills to further their careers and reach their potentials. However, going through college is not necessarily an easy path. The purpose of this study is to enhance university students' well-being and educational experience by examining factors associated with stress and well-being.

The investigator plans to recruit eighty participants from a large public university in the US to provide survey data and saliva samples at two waves during the data collection semester (beginning and end of the semester). Survey data will include demographic information and help gauge psychosocial factors related to stress and well-being. Saliva will be tested for two biomarkers each wave of data collection, cortisol (sampling three times a day for diurnal patterns for two consecutive days) and c-reactive protein, which indicate physiological stress/immune responses. Additionally, participants be randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 40) or control group (n = 40), where the intervention group will undertake a brief intervention focused on motivation and emotion regulation circa mid-semester and the control group will receive a placebo goal-setting short training. The investigator aims to examine whether intervention efforts can enhance end-of-semester psychological and physiological well-being, and particularly, whether students from diverse backgrounds (e.g., first-generation, low-income, and/or BIPOC) can benefit from the intervention.

The investigator will use advanced quantitative data analysis (using Mplus v.8, in a structural equation modeling framework) to examine intervention efficacy and group differences. The investigator hypothesizes that those receiving the intervention will display a healthier profile at the end of the semester compared to their control group counterparts; and the investigator hypothesize students from diverse backgrounds will have significantly improved results from the intervention.

However, it has been determined that there is no study examining the impacts of this disease on functional capacity, physical activity, pulmonary function, emotional state, sleep, and quality of life in healthy young adults. This study will reveal whether COVID-19 disease causes an effect on the mentioned parameters in young adults. The aim of recent study is to investigate functional capacity, respiration, pain, depression, sleep and quality of life in young adults post COVID-19. For this purpose, participants' upper extremity and lower extremity muscle strength, 6-minute walking distance, O2 saturation, posture evaluation, spirometric evaluation, pain threshold, pain intensity, dyspnea, and leg fatigue measurements will be recorded. In addition to these measurements, general fatigue, quality of life, depression, physical activity level, sleep quality parameters will be evaluated and the data obtained will be analyzed with appropriate statistical methods.

The aim of this seamless phase I/II single-dose, single-arm trial is to investigate if RAFT-OS is a safe and effective alternative treatment for patients with aniridia related keratopathy (ARK) in 21 patients.

ARK is a complication of aniridia, which is a genetic eye condition present from birth.

RAFT-OS is an artificial tissue, populated with limbal epithelial cells and stromal cells. The source of the adult limbal and stromal cells is from donated human corneas from the NHS blood and Transplant, Tissue and Eye services in Liverpool.

Following a Screening visit, participants will commence 10-weeks of immune suppression therapy to prepare for the transplantation of RAFT-OS.

The RAFT-OS will be transplanted into the participants worst affected eye. Following surgery, each participant will be assessed at days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 1-month for major or intermediate safety events. Participants will continue to be followed up to 12 months after transplantation and will be required to stay on the immune suppression therapy for the duration of the trial.

The trial is conducted at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (MEH), London in the United Kingdom (UK). MEH is a leading provider of eye health services in the UK and is a world-class centre of excellence for ophthalmic research and education.

Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) accounts for \~ 35% of all LQTS cases and is difficult to manage, as beta-blockers frequently fail to provide full protection. Most LQT2 patients (pts) have a Class 2 mutation, which implies defective ""trafficking"".

Lumacaftor (LUM) is a drug developed and currently indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. LUM corrects protein folding and trafficking defects of mutant and misfolded CFTR channels, restoring their cell surface expression. The investigators recently demonstrated that LUM can rescue in vitro the LQTS phenotype observed in human induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from pts with LQT2 Class 2 mutations (PMID: 29020304) and in these same two patients Orkambi administrated for 7 days at the same dosage approved for cystic fibrosis showed to reduce their QTc (PMID: 30753398).

With the present phase II clinical trial (MAST2) the investigators will enroll 20 LQT2 patients (see inclusion and exclusion criteria) and they will test in vivo the efficacy of Orkambi in shortening their QTc. Patients will be admitted to hospital for a maximum of 7 days (minimum in-hospital stay based on evidence of QTc shortening). Orkambi will be administered at the dose approved for cystic fibrosis and during the entire period continuous ECG monitoring through both telemetry and 12-lead 24-hr Holter monitoring will be performed and QTc length and morphology will be analyzed.",NO,Long QT Syndrome,"DRUG: Lumacaftor / Ivacaftor, Orkambi® Oral Tablet","QT interval, Change in QT interval after drug treatment, 3 to 7 days after start of treatment",,,Istituto Auxologico Italiano,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,16,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,26A804,2021-06-15,2025-04-15,2025-04-15,2020-10-09,,2025-04-25,"Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Ospedale San Luca, Milano, 20149, Italy",

This study addresses SDM adoption of a CV prevention SDM tool in three health systems.",NO,Cardiovascular Risk|Cardiovascular Prevention,BEHAVIORAL: CV Prevention Choice Tool|BEHAVIORAL: Implementation Facilitation Strategies,"Reach metrics, Proportion of eligible clinicians who accessed CV Prevention Choice (among all eligible clinicians), as indicated by EHR user metrics. Higher proportions indicate greater reach., Q1/Year 2 through Q3/Year 4|Effectiveness perceptions, Qualitative findings of the perceptions of tool effectiveness, as assessed through interviews and focus groups with eligible clinicians., Q1/Year 2 through Q3/Year 4|Adoption metrics, Proportion of eligible clinicians that used CV Prevention Choice in encounters identified in the EHR as being eligible for a CV preventive care discussion (among all eligible visits), as indicated by EHR user metrics. Higher proportions indicate greater adoption., Q1/Year 2 through Q3/Year 4|Adoption perceptions, Qualitative findings of reasons for adoption of or failure to adopt CV Prevention Choice, as assessed through interviews and focus groups with eligible clinicians., Q1/Year 2 through Q3/Year 4|Implementation fidelity, A sample of SDM clinical encounters will be audio-video recorded. Recordings will be reviewed and scored according to a five-point SDM fidelity checklist. Higher scores indicate greater fidelity to the core components of SDM., Q1/Year 4 through Q3/Year 4|Implementation SDM quality, Adherence to SDM quality will be assessed among a sample of patients with SDM clinical encounters using the Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) questionnaire. Higher scores are indicative of higher levels of SDM occurring in the encounter. Range of scores is 0 to 100., Q1/Year 4 through Q3/Year 4|Implementation care quality, Care quality will be assessed among a sample of patients with SDM clinical encounters using the 10-item CARE Patient Feedback Measure. Higher scores are indicative of higher patient reported relational empathy in the consultation. Range of scores is 10 to 50., Q1/Year 4 through Q3/Year 4|Maintenance metrics, Change in CV PREVENTION CHOICE use, as indicated by EHR user metrics for eligible clinicians, at the start and end of the maintenance stage. Equivalent or higher use at the end of the maintenance stage indicates maintenance of the tool as part of routine practice., Q1/Year 4 through Q3/Year 4|Maintenance self-report, The NoMAD questionnaire will be administered to clinicians to assess normalization of CV Prevention Choice into practice. The NoMAD questionnaire is a continuous outcome converted to a 0-100 point scale, where higher scores indicate higher levels or normalization of CV Prevention Choice into routine care., Q1/Year 4 through Q3/Year 4","SDM Effectiveness, The assessment of statin prescription post encounter of interest is congruent with the patient estimated CV Risk based off EHR data., Q1/Year 2 through Q3/Year 4",,Mayo Clinic,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,112127,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,20-002772,2021-05-10,2024-12-31,2025-04-29,2020-06-30,,2025-05-02,"Wellstar Health System, Marietta, Georgia, 30060, United States|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|Altru Health System, Grand Forks, North Dakota, 58201, United States|VHC Health, Arlington, Virginia, 22205, United States",
