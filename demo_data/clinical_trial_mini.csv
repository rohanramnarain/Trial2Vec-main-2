0,NCT03760770,"Background: The objective of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is to increase the binding of intrafibrillary and interfibrillary covalent bonds to improve the mechanical stability of the cornea and thus to stop the progression of corneal ectasias. Although the vast majority of studies have described pain after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), the pathophysiological principle of pain is similar in CXL. From the anatomical point of view, the corneal epithelium is the most densely innervated and sensitive surface of the body, being 300-600 times greater than in the skin. The pain after CXL comes from several routes, the process begins with the epithelial rupture that generates exposure of the nerve endings, induces apoptosis and necrosis of the epithelial cells. Subsequently an inflammatory cascade is initiated in which the different cytokines stimulate the nerve terminals. Inflammatory mediators also activate the ion channels in the nerve membrane, and this process continues until the epithelium heals. Additionally, exposure to UVA rays can also cause nerve damage. The effect of local cold for pain management has already been reported in PRK. By cooling the cornea, the release of chemical mediators and inflammation can be reduced. In the CXL radiation is transformed into several forms of energy: fluorescent radiation, chemical energy and, to a small extent, heat. The CXL process is energetically comparable to photosynthesis, in which the radiation energy is transformed into chemical energy (glucose) with the help of pigments (chlorophyll). The thermal effect is negligible in the photochemical method of CXL. Justification: No method for the control of pain after crosslinking is considered ideal or universally accepted, the importance of this study lies in looking for an additional tool to reduce the most common postoperative complaint in a highly performed procedure worldwide. Hypothesis: The application of riboflavin at 4oC reduces the pain assessment after the CXL. Purpose: to evaluate the effect of the application of riboflavin at 4oC in the assessment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing CXL.

26,NCT03760354,"The management of patients who have ingested a caustic product has changed since 2007. Whereas previously the lesion assessment and surgical indication were based on endoscopic data, the therapeutic algorithm is currently based solely on the results of a CT scan with contrast injection, performed 6 hours after ingestion. This examination makes it possible to reliably assess the viability of the esophageal and gastric walls and thus to indicate digestive resection. The therapeutic consequences of this new treatment are important because, by expanding the indications for conservative treatment after severe ingestion, it brings a significant gain in terms of survival, morbidity and functional outcome. In the absence of emergency digestive resection, however, the functional prognosis is often overshadowed by the formation of esophageal stenosis in the months following ingestion. Patients then require endoscopic dilation treatment. In the event of failure or impossibility of dilation, which defines refractory stenosis, esophageal reconstruction is necessary. In case of sequential pharyngeal stenosis following ingestion, esophageal and pharyngeal reconstruction is indicated as a first-line treatment, since these stenosis do not respond to endoscopic dilations. The expansion of the indications for conservative treatment after severe ingestion using CT scans has led to an increase in the incidence of after-effect stenosis.~We aim to develop a therapeutic approach that will prevent the development of refractory and pharyngeal esophageal stenosis. Indeed, there is currently no strategy that has proven effective in this regard in adults. The value of corticosteroid therapy for the prevention of caustic stenosis has only been evaluated in children and remains controversial.~The main objective is to evaluate the effect of early systemic corticosteroid therapy on the risk of refractory esophageal or pharyngeal stenosis within one year of ingestion of a caustic substance in a population of patients at high risk of stenosis, defined according to tomodensitometric criteria (grade IIb: severe lesions, absence of transparietal necrosis), and for whom there is no indication of urgent digestive resection.",Corticosteroid Treatment in the Acute Phase of Caustic Ingestion Management,"Methylprednisolone, Placebo","Caustic Esophageal Injury, Esophageal Stenosis, Pharyngeal Stenosis","Esophageal Stenosis, Caustic, Pharyngeal Stenosis, Corticosteroid treatment","Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha), Tissue Growth Factor Beta (TGF beta), Tissue Growth Factor Beta (TGF beta), Tissue Growth Factor Beta (TGF beta), Tissue Growth Factor Beta (TGF beta), Galectin 3, Galectin 3, Galectin 3, Galectin 3, Indication for esophageal or pharyngeal surgical reconstruction, Distance of the stenosis, Delay in the occurrence of refractory stenosis or pharyngeal stenosis, Delay in the occurrence of refractory stenosis or pharyngeal stenosis, Delay in the occurrence of refractory stenosis or pharyngeal stenosis, Delay in the occurrence of refractory stenosis or pharyngeal stenosis, Delay in the occurrence of refractory esophagal stenosis or pharyngeal stenosis, Distance of the stenosis, Distance of the stenosis, Distance of the stenosis, Distance of the stenosis, Number of stenosis, Number of stenosis, Number of stenosis, Number of stenosis, Number of stenosis, Length of stenosis, Length of stenosis, Length of stenosis, Length of stenosis, Length of stenosis, Estimated diameter of stenosis, Estimated diameter of stenosis, Estimated diameter of stenosis, Estimated diameter of stenosis, Estimated diameter of stenosis, Endoluminal inflammation, Endoluminal inflammation, Endoluminal inflammation, Endoluminal inflammation, Endoluminal inflammation, Number of dilation sessions, Number of dilation sessions, Number of dilation sessions, Number of dilation sessions, Number of dilation sessions, Intervals between iterative dilations, Intervals between iterative dilations, Intervals between iterative dilations, Intervals between iterative dilations, Intervals between iterative dilations, Digestive perforations, Digestive perforations, Digestive perforations, Digestive perforations, Digestive perforations, Extent of pharyngeal stenosis, Extent of pharyngeal stenosis, Extent of pharyngeal stenosis, Extent of pharyngeal stenosis, Extent of pharyngeal stenosis, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of unanticipated adverse reactions, Proportion of adverse reactions related to corticosteroid therapy, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), interleukin-1 (IL1), interleukin-1 (IL1), interleukin-1 (IL1), interleukin-1 (IL1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha), Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha)","Inclusion Criteria~Age greater than or equal to 18 years~Recent caustic product ingestion (time between taking the product and initiating the evaluated treatment or placebo between 6 and 24 hours after ingestion)~Predictive CT criteria for high-risk esophageal stenosis (grade IIb) in its most pathological part~Written, signed consent (trusted person if necessary, in case of impossibility of collection)~Beneficiary of a social security system~Exclusion Criteria:~Indication of resection or surgical exploration in emergency~History of caustic ingestion~Corticosteroids taken at a dose greater than 20 mg prednisone within 7 days before randomization~Contraindication to corticosteroid therapy:~Any infectious condition that required antibiotic treatment within 7 days of randomization~Any vaccine living within 7 days of randomization~Hypersensitivity to one of the components~Pregnancy in progress~Breastfeeding in progress~Co-intoxication involving vital prognosis and requiring, according to the patient's doctor, intensive care management~Patient under guardianship or curatorship",none,Not yet recruiting

37,NCT00353860,"This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in which the donor s T cells (a type of lymphocyte, or white blood cell) have been removed and then added back. Certain patients with bone marrow malignancies undergo transplantation of donated stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into the different blood components white cells, red cells and platelets) to generate new and normally functioning bone marrow. However, T-cells from the donor may see the patient s cells as foreign and mount an immune response to reject them, causing what is called graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Therefore, in this study, T-cells are removed from the donor cells to prevent this complication. Nevertheless, there are disadvantages of removing the T-cells, since they are important in fighting viral infections as well as any remaining malignant cells. The attack against the malignant cells is called a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Therefore, donor T cells are given to the patient (added back) later (45 and 100 days after the transplant) when they can provide needed immunity with less risk of causing GVHD.~Patients between 10 and 55 years of age with chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, a myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia may be eligible for this study. Prospective participants and their donors are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests (including a test to match for genetic compatibility), breathing tests, chest and sinus X-rays, and tests of heart function. They also undergo a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration. For this procedure, done under local anesthetic, about a tablespoon of bone marrow is withdrawn through a needle inserted into the hipbone.~Participants may undergo apheresis to collect lymphocytes for research studies. This procedure involves collecting blood through a needle in the arm, similar to donating a unit of blood. The lymphocytes are then separated and removed by a cell separator machine, and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.~Before treatment begins, patients have a central venous catheter (flexible plastic tube) placed in a vein. This line remains in place during the stem cell transfusion and recovery period for drawing and transfusing blood, giving medications, and infusing the donated cells. Preparation for the transfusion includes irradiation and chemotherapy. Patients undergo total body irradiation in 8 doses given in two 30-minute sessions a day for 4 days. Four days before the transfusion, they begin taking cyclophosphamide, and 9days before the procedure they start fludarabine. These are anti-cancer drugs that kill the cancer cells and prevent rejection of the donated cells.

39,NCT03760172,"NAFLD is a common comordidity in patients with IMID, including inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis.~Nevertheless, the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in the IMID population is not clear, and the risk factors are not completely understood. Interestingly, NASH and most of IMIDs share main molecular and immunological mechanisms of disease, as the inflammatory pathways depending on TNFa or imbalance in T cell subtypes like Th17/Treg. This common pathogenesis may explain, at least in a subset of patients, the development of NASH in the absence of classic metabolic risk factor.~Thus, our main hypothesis is that in the NASH assciated to IMIDs two different phenotypes co-exist.~First, a predominantly inflammatory phenotype, and not associated to the metabolic syndrome ande second, a predominantly metabolic phenptype, strongly associated to he metabolic syndrome.~In this way, we believe that in a particular subset of NAFLD patients, NASH could be considered as an IMID, as most of the definiting features of IMIDs are present. To demonstrate our hypothesis, we consider a two-stage study. First, we will determine the NAFLD and NASH prevalence in a cohort of well-characterized IMID patients and controls. Second, we will adress the molecular and immunophenotype characterization in liver biopsies of NASH patients with and without the co-existence of IMIDs.",Immunomediated Non-alcoholic SteaTohepatitis; Prevalence and Characterization.

40,NCT03760159,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by recurrent nocturnal respiratory interruptions, resulting from the total or partial collapse of the upper respiratory ways. This results into sleep fragmentation, metabolic and biological disorders, which alter the neuropsychological and cardiovascular systems. Nowadays, 24% of men and 9% of women aged 30 to 60 years disclose already an asymptomatic and underdiagnosed sleep disorder breathing (SDB). In subjects suffering from cardiovascular disease, prevalence of SDB is higher than in the general population, reaching 87% in people with resistant hypertension, 51% in those with heart failure and 62% in those with atrial fibrillation (to cite a few).The current diagnostic tool for SDB is polysomnography (PSG), but this is an expensive, time-consuming and uncomfortable tool, which limits its wide-spread use despite the high frequency of SDB in general and, even more, in patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Several screening devices exist in order to test those patients at risk of SDB, but these have several limitations, since they are not recommended in patients who are asymptomatic for apnoea, in those with cardiorespiratory diseases, nocturnal arrhythmias or neurological and metabolic co-morbidities. In other words, nowadays there isn't an efficient screening tool of SDB, mainly for those with a low pre-test probability of having SDB.~Preliminary evidence suggests that the seismocardiography (SCG) and the ballistocardiography (BCG) can detect nocturnal awakening and sleep disturbances with a good sensitivity and accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art PSG. Simultaneous recording of SCG and BCG is called kinocardiography (KCG) and has not been performed yet during sleep.~The main hypothesis tested in this study is that the KCG provides sensitive and accurate measures of obstructive and central apnoea as compared to the state-of-the-art PSG. The secondary hypotheses are related to modifications in the SCG and BCG signals during the apnoea and the effects of continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) therapy. These hypotheses will be tested through a series of studies in normal volunteers and patients, as follow:~Group RESPIRATOIRYSIMUL (Study A): voluntary end-expiratory breathing cessations periods and obstructive voluntary apnoea's (n=46);~Group SBD (Study B): patients admitted for complains of sleep disturbances without cardiovascular and/or respiratory abnormalities which could induce artifacts in the KCG recording (n=50);~Group nCPAP (Study C): patients treated by nCPAP therapy (n=50);~Group UNSELECTED (Study D): unselected consecutive patients (n=100), without recruitment restrictions.~Study A is an interventional study on voluntary breath holding in normal volunteers. Studies B, C and D are observational investigations recruiting subjects referred for PSG as required by their medical condition. Because the KCG device is not intrusive, the investigators do not anticipate difficulties in the enrollment. This study will not affect in any manner the regular medical care of the patients admitted to the sleep laboratory.~To conclude, SDB is a widespread disease with detrimental health effects and its prevalence is supposed to increase in future years. PSG is the gold standard for diagnosis of SDB but it is an expensive, uncomfortable and time-consuming tool, limiting its use in daily clinical practice. For subjects with a high pre-test probability of SDB, portable, inexpensive and easy-to-use tools have been proposed as sleep monitoring and seem to provide accurate estimates of SDB. Although such devices seem promising, they disclose also several limitations and are not universally accepted as SDB screening devices, mainly in case of low pre-test probability of SBD. The less cumbersome KCG may screen patients for SDB accurately. One of its unique features is also that it can directly identify the consequences of SDB and nCPAP therapy on the cardiovascular system, and in especially the presence of frequently associated cardiac arrhythmias. With a more efficient pre-screening, those who are most likely to be eligible for nCPAP therapy will have a better access to the currently existing sleep laboratory facilities.

50,NCT02283333,"The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of an experimental treatment (termed BATE-G) for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) in Veterans compared to the current, VA-approved standard of care treatment. Currently, treatments for grief in Veterans remain understudied. Our research group has recently completed pilot work on an innovative, technology-leveraged treatment protocol for PGD that combines Behavioral Activation with Therapeutic Exposure (BATE) and appears readily applicable to the Veteran and Military populations. Per the VA / DoD Iraq War Clinician Guide, 2nd ed., the current standard of treatment is Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling.~The study will enroll 140 Veterans, aged 21 years and older, who served in any combat era. All Veterans will meet criteria for PGD. There will be assessments at baseline, 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months post treatment. During the treatment phase, Veterans will undergo 7 weekly sessions of either BATE-G or standard treatment. Sessions 2-6 will be delivered via televideo to the Veteran's home.~We hypothesize that BATE-G will be more effective than standard treatment in reducing symptoms of PGD, both at post-treatment and follow-up.

72,NCT03759691,"Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of long-term disability. Annually 12,000 people in Denmark suffers a stroke; half of them will have long-term disabilities that may affect the activities of daily living. In addition to substantial individual suffering, stroke is also associated with considerable costs to society. Acute reperfusion therapies started within 4.5 to 6 hours (in some up to 24 hours) from symptom onset for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) have revolutionized the acute stroke treatment and considerably improved the overall prognosis and mortality. However, only 15-25% of Danish patients are eligible to acute treatment. Numerous attempts to reduce both prehospital and in-hospital delay in stroke have been made, but much time is still lost in the prehospital phase.~Many stroke patients do not recognize their own symptoms as signs of a stroke or do not understand the importance of calling Emergecy Medical Services (EMS) immediately. Others cannot call for help unless they have a bystander, because of cognitive impairment or aphasia. Some patients have a wait-and-see attitude, contact their GP or out-of-hours GP, which also can increase the delay. Educational stroke campaigns can increase knowledge, improve help-seeking behaviour and increase the number of patients eligible for reperfusion therapies. The foundation TrygFonden is planning a national stroke campaign in 2019.~Aims:~To explore the knowledge of stroke in stroke patients and bystanders.~To explore the process from onset of symptoms until admission to hospital and the reasons for prehospital delay.~To explore the association between stroke knowledge, help-seeking behaviour and receiving revascularization therapy.~To evaluate the immediate effect of the national campaign six months after initiation.~Material and methods:~Study 1:~Structured interviews of stroke patients (and bystanders) admitted to the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital and Regional Hospital West Jutland (Holstebro). The investigators will use the patient's medical record (EPJ) and the Danish Stroke Register (DSR) and map the patient's route from onset of symptoms to admission to stroke centre, including contact to general practitioner (GP), out-of-hours GP or Emergency Medical Services (EMS). For patients who have been in contact with their GP, the GP will receive an electronic questionnaire to explore the time- and event pathway from first contact until admitting the patient to hospital. The investigators will interview 500 patients and approximately 300 bystanders over a period of 3 months.~Study 2:~The investigators will evaluate the effect of the national stroke campaign by conducting a similar study in 2020 when the campaign has been running for six months.~Perspectives:~This study will provide new information about stroke patients and bystanders, their knowledge of stroke and their help-seeking behaviour. If more knowledge about the factors that cause prehospital delay in stroke treatment are obtained, the investigators will know which areas to focus on in the future to improve the outcome for stroke patients. Part of this project will examine the effect of TrygFondens national stroke campaign, which is expected to have impact on general knowledge and help-seeking behaviour. If more people know the core symptoms of stroke, hopefully more people will also know how to react to these symptoms by calling EMS.

78,NCT03759626,Alcohol is the psychoactive substance most experienced by young people. It benefits from positive representations that are reinforced by marketing strategies where advertisers integrate their products into TV series. Our project takes into account the reflexive and impulsive model developed by Strack & Deutsch (2004). We will compare the impulsive intervention to an educational module based on information and reflection that uses the individual's reflexive system with 30 classes in the Loire and Rhône departments. The intervention framework developed uses a modeling system that includes several concepts that work together. These concepts describe the influence of media messages on young people's opinions and behaviours. Given that the objective is to reduce the positive representations of alcohol among young people by means of an educational module based on information and reflection (reflexive model) and a module based on the impulsive system where the para-social connection is involved.

If IPE delays the onset of AD by even 5 years, the incidence of AD would be reduced by 50% in this population and could have a profound effect on Veteran quality of life and healthcare costs.",Brain Amyloid and Vascular Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid,"icosapent ethyl (IPE), gel cap placebo",Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease, Cerebrospinal fluid, brain blood flow, cognition, icosapent ethyl, Vascepa, omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid","Regional cerebral blood flow using arterial spin-labeling MRI, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, cognitive performance","Inclusion Criteria:~United States Veteran eligible for VA care~Age 50-75 years, inclusive~Cognitively healthy~Exclusion Criteria:~Dementia or mild cognitive impairment on screening evaluation~Current use of fish oil supplements (requires 3 month wash-out period)~Active liver disease with AST or ALT greater than twice the upper limit of normal~Elevated creatine kinase greater than twice the upper limit of normal~Prior adverse reaction to statins or fish oil~Pregnant, nursing, or pregnancy planned~Use of medications that interact with icosapent ethyl~Current use of anticoagulants~Known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish~Current use of other investigational drug~History of significant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus~Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or =190 mg/dL or <80 mg/dL~Triglycerides > or = 500 mg/dL~Creatinine >1.8 mg/dL~Previous lumbar surgery with contraindication to lumbar puncture~Claustrophobia requiring sedation for MRI~Pacemaker or other contraindication for MRI~Consumption of >200 mg per day omega-3 fatty acids in diet",none,"Active, not recruiting"

98,NCT02284126,"This study is a collaboration between New York Presbyterian (NYP)-Columbia and NYP-Cornell that seeks to evaluate the use of topical vancomycin and its reduction on surgical site infection (SSI) in neurosurgical procedures. Adult patients undergoing neurosurgery at either institution will be eligible for participation in this randomized control trial. Patients randomized to the treatment group will receive 2g of vancomycin applied as a powder or paste to the wound site and/or bone flap. Subjects in the control group will receive the current standard of care without topical vancomycin. All subjects will undergo swabbing of the anterior nares and the surgical site prior to surgery, once 10-14 days following the operation and 90 days following the operation. The primary outcome measure will be surgical site infection, assessed daily throughout the hospital stay, at the first follow-up visit, and by telephone at 14-30 days and 90 days (+/- 7 days). Secondary outcomes will include length of hospital stay, length of intensive care stay, rate of reoperation and patient mortality. In addition, systemic vancomycin levels will be assessed at 6 hours and 20 hours postoperatively in each patient. Patients who have an external ventricular drain in place will have vancomycin levels assessed daily. In patients who have cranial drains placed, vancomycin concentrations will be analyzed from daily in wound drainage. Skin and nasal flora will be analyzed to assess the impact of topical vancomycin on the patient microbiome. Although there has been a decrease in the incidence of infections following craniotomy secondary to prophylactic intravenous antibiotics, proper sterile techniques, and other interventions, SSIs continue to significantly impact morbidity, mortality, and cost burden. Although never studied in neurosurgical procedures other than instrumented spine, the application of topical vancomycin to the surgical site prior to wound closure has demonstrated a reduction in SSIs in spine, cardiac and ophthalmologic procedures. The benefits of using prophylactic vancomycin topically, as opposed to intravenously, include reduced systemic levels of the drug, and therefore, a decreased probability of adverse events related to the drug, such as inducing resistance among the native flora.
