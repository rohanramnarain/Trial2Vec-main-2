The ordinal joint score assesses 9 items in 6 index joints., Yearly up to 5 years|Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument - Hemophilia Activities List (HAL), HAL is a disease specific measure of the impact of hemophilia on functional abilities in adults. The instrument consists of 42 items across 7 domains, utilizing a past month recall period. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-6 with higher recoded scores indicating more functional limitations., Yearly up to 5 years|Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument - Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults (Haem-A-QoL), Haem-A-QoL is a disease specific measure of health-related quality of life in patients with hemophilia. Intended for adults, the instrument uses a 4-week recall period to assess health across 10 domains consisting of 46 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-6 with lower scores indicating better health-related quality of life., Yearly up to 5 years|Incidence and severity of AEs, 5-year study period",,Pfizer,,MALE,ADULT,PHASE3,76,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,C3731003|2019-004451-37,2020-08-18,2024-06-17,2028-10-25,2020-04-30,,2025-04-15,"NOW Physical Therapy, Mountain View, California, 94040, United States|Clinical and Translational Research Unit (CTRU), Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|Imaging Clinic at Stanford Medicine Outpatient Center in Redwood City, Redwood City, California, 94063, United States|UCSF IDS Pharmacy, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|University of California, San Francisco - Clinical Research Center, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|University of California, San Francisco - Moffitt/Long Inpatient Hematology, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|University of California, San Francisco - Outpatient Hematology Clinic, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|Stanford Health Care, Stanford, California, 94305, United States|Washington Institute for Coagulation, Seattle, Washington, 98101, United States|University of Washington Medical Center - Translational Research Unit (TRU), Seattle, Washington, 98195, United States|The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, 3004, Australia|Centro de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Campinas - Hemocentro UNICAMP, Campinas, SAO Paulo, 13083-878, Brazil|McMaster University Medical Centre - Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, L8N 3Z5, Canada|Juravinski Hospital - Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, L8V 1C3, Canada|Hopital Necker, Paris, 75015, France|Vivantes Klinikum im Friedrichshain, Berlin, 10249, Germany|Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitaet, Medizinische Klinik II, Frankfurt am Main, 60590, Germany|General Hospital of Athens ''Laiko'', Athens, Attikí, 115 27, Greece|General Hospital of Athens ""Hippokration"", Athens, 11527, Greece|General Hospital of Athens ""LAIKO"", 2nd Regional Blood Transfusion Center, Athens, 11527, Greece|Università degli studi di Roma ""La Sapienza""- Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, RM, 00161, Italy|Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi SODc Malattie Emorragiche e della Coagulazione, Firenze, 50134, Italy|Dip. di Medicina Clinica e Chirurgia, Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II - UOC di Medicina, Napoli, 80131, Italy|Nagoya University Hospital - Transfusion Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8560, Japan|Saitama Medical University Hospital, Iruma-gun, Saitama, 350-0495, Japan|Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, 05278, Korea, Republic of|King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, 08035, Spain|H.U.
