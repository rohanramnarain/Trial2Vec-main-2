NCT04180488,"Dupilumab for the Treatment of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria in Patients Who Remain Symptomatic Despite the Use of H1 Antihistamine and Who Are naïve to, Intolerant of, or Incomplete Responders to Omalizumab (LIBERTY-CSU CUPID)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04180488,,COMPLETED,"Primary Objective:

To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab in study participants with CSU who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1 antihistamine (Study A and C: omalizumab naïve; Study B: omalizumab intolerant or incomplete responders)
