NCT04469595,A Study of Intravitreal ILUVIEN® Implant as Baseline Therapy in Patients With Early Diabetic Macular Edema (DME),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04469595,NEW DAY,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This is a randomized, masked, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study that will assess the efficacy of ILUVIEN as a baseline therapy in the treatment of Center Involving DME (CI-DME). The study will enroll patients who are either treatment naïve or have not received any DME treatments for the preceding 12 months as documented in medical records. Patients who received DME treatment \>12 months before screening, must not have received \>4 intravitreal injections. The study will compare 2 treatment regimens: ILUVIEN intravitreal implant (0.19 mg) followed by supplemental aflibercept as needed per protocol criteria (2 mg/0.05 mL), compared to intravitreal aflibercept loading dose (2 mg administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks for 5 consecutive doses) followed by supplemental aflibercept as needed per protocol criteria (2 mg/0.05 mL).",NO,Diabetic Macular Edema,DRUG: Iluvien 0.19 MG Drug Implant|DRUG: Aflibercept,"The mean total number of supplemental aflibercept injections needed during the study, The mean total number of supplemental aflibercept injections needed during, Baseline to 18 months","Proportion of subjects with 15, 10 and 5 letter (ETDRS) gains from baseline, Proportion of subjects with 15, 10 and 5 letter (ETDRS) gains from baseline, At 18 months|Area under the curve (AUC) of Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Area under the curve (AUC) of Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Baseline to 18 months|Mean change from baseline in Center Subfield Thickness (CST), Mean change from baseline in Center Subfield Thickness (CST), Baseline to 18 months|Area under the curve (AUC) of Center Subfield Thickness (CST), Area under the curve (AUC) of Center Subfield Thickness (CST), Baseline to 18 months|Mean change from baseline in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) composite score and subscale scores, The NEI VFQ-25 is a questionnaire that allows the individual to report on their level of visual function.
