NCT06954688,The Influence of Dry Needling for Hypertonia and Spasticity Treatment on Neuropathic Pain in Lower Extremity of Spinal Cord Injury: A Case Series Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06954688,,TERMINATED,"Spinal cord injury is a life-changing event that places a burden on the healthcare system, including caregivers and affected individuals. Studies do not provide a conclusive incidence rate due to methodological differences. However, a trend observed in recent years is an increasing incidence among the elderly population due to falls or non-traumatic spinal cord injury.

The clinical consequences of spinal cord injury include pain and spasticity, in addition to loss of function and activity. On average, 69% of spinal cord injury patients report pain, with one-third experiencing severe pain. A similar prevalence is seen for spasticity, which is often underreported among spinal cord injury patients. Unlike pain, spasticity is considered a common symptom in chronic spinal cord injury, with at least 35% of the SCI population suffering from this sensorimotor control disorder. These two symptoms suggest a correlation, yet clear evidence is lacking.

The secondary aim of this study is to explain the mechanisms of action of Dry Needling at various levels to better determine which subgroup of spinal cord injury patients would benefit most. A targeted study could optimize the effects of such a treatment: a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help with patient stratification and promote a more individualized approach, taking into account the pathogenesis of spasticity and the different mechanisms that can effectively modulate it.

Additionally, this study examines the effect of the dry needling technique on hypertonia and spasticity in the spastic calf muscles of spinal cord injury patients. Research has already shown that this technique has acute effects on hypertonia and spasticity in stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. However, reliable research on spinal cord injury is lacking-currently, only a case report has investigated these effects. Therefore, this study is well-suited to build upon that case report and provide more evidence.

Furthermore, this study serves as a prospective study to observe the correlation between neuropathic pain and spasticity over time. As a pilot study, it has established a collaboration with the REVARTE rehabilitation hospital, which has a large spinal cord injury population.

The research will be conducted under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Steven Truijen (Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium, steven.truijen@uantwerpen.be) and Prof. Dr. Wim Saeys (Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium, wim.saeys@uantwerpen.be), organized from the University of Antwerp. During this study, no research costs will be charged to the patient, health insurance, or research environment.

Kidney transplantation offers the best survival and quality of life outcomes for patients with end-stage kidney disease but requires life-long immunosuppression. Efforts to increase the donor organ pool means accepting kidneys which have been subjected to medical and surgical factors culminating in acute kidney injury (AKI).

There is no treatment to modify the maladaptive injury process following an AKI insult, and this subjects the new kidney to increased risk of needing dialysis in the first 7 days of transplantation, rejection, and shortened transplant survival.

Tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDC) are currently used in phase I/II clinical trials and are safe for patients receiving a kidney transplant from the same donor as these cells. These trials focus on transplant tolerance, but we will re-purpose TolDCs to favorably alter the disease course following AKI and limit injury following transplantation.

Furthermore, if the patient's own cells (rather than from a third-party donor) can be used, this avoids supply limitations and potential sensitization risk.

* Are the amounts of excreted sodium in the urine during the 2- and 6-hours' time period after a morning dose of extended release torsemide different from the amounts after the immediate release torsemide.
* Are the amounts of excreted sodium in the urine during the 2- and 6-hours' time period after a salty lunch, which will be consumed approximately 6 hours following a morning dose of extended release torsemide, different from the amounts after the immediate release torsemide.
* Is the amount of excreted sodium in the urine during the 24 hours' time period after a salty lunch, which will be consumed approximately 6 hours following a morning dose of extended release torsemide, different from the amount after the immediate release torsemide.

NCT06077487,Ketamine-assisted Therapy for Advanced GI Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06077487,,TERMINATED,"This clinical trial evaluates whether it is possible to use a single dose of ketamine in combination with talk therapy to treat moderate to severe demoralization in patients with stage 3 or 4 gastrointestinal (GI) cancers who take opioids for cancer-related pain. Advanced stage gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients often suffer from high rates of psychosocial distress and pain. Symptoms of anxiety are highly prevalent among gastrointestinal (GI) cancers patients. While opioid analgesia (pain reliever) succeeds in managing some symptoms, chronic opioid therapy is associated with significant adverse effects, underscoring a need to identify alternative interventions in the treatment of cancer associated pain. GI cancer patients frequently suffer from existential distress, and demoralization is a form of existential distress that is common among people with serious medical illnesses. Demoralization is characterized by poor coping with stressful events, and a loss of meaning and purpose in life. Talk therapy is a form of psychological treatment during which patients discuss problems, thoughts, and feelings. Ketamine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of depression, suicidality, and pain in non-cancer patients. This study may help researchers learn whether ketamine and talk therapy combined may improve psychosocial distress and pain, as well as decreases opioid analgesic use in patients with advanced GI cancer who take opioids for cancer-related pain.",NO,"Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Pain, Acute|Gastrointestinal Cancers|Demoralization",DRUG: Ketamine|DRUG: Ketamine Injectable Product|BEHAVIORAL: Meaning and Purpose therapy|OTHER: Placebo|OTHER: Questionnaires,"Proportion eligible versus screened participants., The rate of recruitment is defined as the proportion of eligible participants who participate compared to the number of total participants who were screened or signed consent but did not meet eligibility criteria will be reported., Up to 28 days|Proportion of participants who complete therapy, Proportion of enrolled participants completing K-MaP intervention and all Demoralization Scale II (DS-II) assessments will be reported., Up to 49 days|Frequency of participant responses to intervention acceptability, The participants will provide qualitative feedback on the acceptability of the intervention via a 20-minute interview with the study team upon study termination.

NCT05934903,Feasibility Study: tDCS for Treatment of Refractory Status Epilepticus,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05934903,,TERMINATED,"Status epilepticus, or recurrent seizures without return to baseline, is a neurologic emergency. Refractory status epilepticus occurs when seizures are resistant to multiple first line anti-seizure medications. The ability to quickly stop seizures is paramount. Transcranial direct current simulation is a non-invasive, easily administered therapy that can potentially help reduce seizure burden.

The goal of this feasibility study is to assess the ability of the study site to enroll patients admitted with refractory seizures or those with abnormal brain wave patterns to take part in a study looking to use transcranial direct current stimulation as an adjunctive treatment. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the recruitment capability of the study site?
* How well can the study site adhere to study protocol?
* Are there any adverse effects of using the transcranial direct current stimulation device?
* How do patients' brain wave studies respond to the stimulation? Participants will be asked to consider joining the study. Once joined, researchers will randomly assign participants to compare transcranial stimulation versus sham stimulation to see if this will affect the participant's brain wave patterns.",NO,Status Epilepticus|Refractory Status Epilepticus,DEVICE: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation,"Recruitment capability of the study site- Incidence, Recruitment capability of the study site will be assessed as the incidence of patients admitted with RSE/SRSE or IIC burden \> 50% within a 24 month period.

NCT05911308,Abequolixron (RGX-104) and Durvalumab in Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05911308,,TERMINATED,"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is one of the deadliest types of cancer. In lung cancer patients with a tumor that can be removed by surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy increases survival. Neoadjuvant therapy may have advantages such as, it may be more tolerable prior to surgery, earlier treatment may be more efficacious, and it can provide an indication of treatment response. Neoadjuvant treatment can provide pre- and post-treatment specimens for correlative analysis to better understand mechanisms of action and resistance.

This pilot study will investigate the effects of neoadjuvant durvalumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy and neoadjuvant durvalumab plus platinum doublet chemotherapy in combination with abequolixron (RGX-104), an LXR/ApoE agonist, in subjects with NSCLC who are scheduled to undergo surgical resection as part of their standard of care.

The purpose of this study is to study how well using a combination of durvalumab, platinum doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/abraxane or carboplatin/pemetrexed), and abequolixron treats non-small cell lung cancer before surgery. Durvalumab (a type of immunotherapy) and platinum doublet chemotherapy are drugs that are individually approved for use during the treatment of cancer.

As the diagnosis is generally considered terminal, patients with GBM often suffer from anxiety and other comorbid conditions, including depression, pain, and sleep disturbance, all of which significantly impact their quality of life.

Further, recent in-vitro and in-vivo work suggests potential cytotoxic and anti-tumor effects of CBD and other cannabinoids.

This study includes a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of a custom formulated, full-spectrum, hemp-derived ultra-high CBD product on measures of anxiety, pain, and quality of life in newly-diagnosed GBM patients undergoing standard of care (SOC) treatment; the impact of this product vs. placebo on tumor progression will also be assessed.

NCT05690152,Persistence of Glaucoma Patients With Web-Browser-Based Visual Field Test,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05690152,,TERMINATED,"The goal of this clinical trial is to assess patient persistence and adherence with a 6-month period of at-home visual field testing, using a novel web-based visual field test (EyeSimplify, M\&S Technologies, Niles, IL).

The main questions this clinical trials aims to answer are:

1. How adherent patients are to biweekly testing at home for 6 months, and
2. How patients feel the ease of user experience of the test was, and
3. Whether the EyeSimplify platform is able to detect any worsening of glaucoma-related visual field performance that can be corroborated by standard of care, office-based testing.

Participants will be given iPads with links to the EyeSimplify visual field test, and asked to take the EyeSimplify tests at home biweekly for six months. The test takes between 10 to 15 minutes to do and participants will have no additional responsibilities between tests.

Researchers will send reminders for patients to complete the at-home tests at periodic intervals, and if worsening on the at-home test platform is suggested by test results, researchers will arrange for return visits to the office to compare the EyeSimplify test results to standard-of-care, office-based testing. At the conclusion of the study, participant adherence to the 6-month biweekly testing schedule will be assessed and participants will be surveyed for their perceptions regarding the EyeSimplify platform's ease of usability and user experience.",NO,Glaucoma,DEVICE: EyeSimplify web-browser-based visual field test,"EyeSimplify Self-Test Adherence, For the purposes of this study, adherence is defined as number of times a subject self-tests divided by the number of times they are expected to self-test during the six-month study period. There will be a total of 14 expected self tests. Adherence will be evaluated at the conclusion of the six-month study period., Subjects will be asked to self-test once every two weeks for six months.|EyeSimplify Self-Test Persistence, For the purposes of this study, persistence is defined as the number of consecutive self-tests a subject completes without a lapse. Persistence will be evaluated at the conclusion of the six-month study period., Subjects will be asked to self-test once every two weeks for six months.","Visual Field Reliability Metric #1 - False Positive Rate, In perimetry (visual field testing), a ""false positive error"" occurs when a subject/patient records a response when no stimulus is presented. This is one metric by which the reliability of a visual field test is measured. The measurement is reported as a percentage., This measurement will automatically be reported upon conclusion of each visual field test. Visual field testing is estimated to take 5-15 minutes for each visual field test. Testing will occur every two weeks for the six-month study period.|Visual Field Reliability Metric #2 - False Negative Rate, In perimetry (visual field testing), a ""false negative error"" occurs when a subject/patient fails to record a response to a stimulus that is brighter than one they had previously responded to in the same visual location. This is one metric by which the reliability of a visual field test is measured. The measurement is reported as a percentage., This measurement will automatically be reported upon conclusion of each visual field test. Visual field testing is estimated to take 5-15 minutes for each visual field test. Testing will occur every two weeks for the six-month study period.|Visual Field Reliability Metric #3 - Fixation Loss Rate, In perimetry (visual field testing), a ""fixation loss"" occurs when a subject/patient records a response to a stimulus presented in the physiologic blind spot. If the patient responds, it indicates their gaze is not fixed straight ahead. This is one metric by which the reliability of a visual field test is measured. The measurement is reported as a percentage., This measurement will automatically be reported upon conclusion of each visual field test. Visual field testing is estimated to take 5-15 minutes for each visual field test. Testing will occur every two weeks for the six-month study period.|Visual Field Performance Metric #1 - Mean Deviation, Mean deviation indicates how much, on average, an entire visual field deviates from the age-normal value. It is the center-weighted average of the decibel deviations at each point tested in the visual field test. The measurement is reported in decibels., This measurement will automatically be reported upon conclusion of each visual field test. Visual field testing is estimated to take 5-15 minutes for each visual field test. Testing will occur every two weeks for the six-month study period.|Visual Field Performance Metric #2 - Pattern Standard Deviation, Pattern standard deviation reflects irregularities in a visual field, such as those caused by localized defects. This metric shows sensitivity losses after adjusting for generalized depression or elevation in the overall hill of vision (e.g. cataracts). The measurement is reported in decibels., This measurement will automatically be reported upon conclusion of each visual field test. Visual field testing is estimated to take 5-15 minutes for each visual field test. Testing will occur every two weeks for the six-month study period.|Visual Field Performance Metric #3 - Total Deviation, Total deviation probability plots identify test locations that are outside normal limits. Threshold sensitivity levels are compared to age-corrected normal values at each test location to produce a total deviation map. Each measurement is reported in decibels., This measurement will automatically be reported upon conclusion of each visual field test. Visual field testing is estimated to take 5-15 minutes for each visual field test. Testing will occur every two weeks for the six-month study period.|Visual Field Performance Metric #4 - Foveal Threshold, Foveal threshold is the minimum amount of luminance increment on a uniform background that can be detected by a subject/patient at the center of fixation. The measurement is reported in decibels., This measurement will automatically be reported upon conclusion of each visual field test. Visual field testing is estimated to take 5-15 minutes for each visual field test. Testing will occur every two weeks for the six-month study period.|Visual Field Loss Trend Metric #1 - Guided Progression Analysis Trend Analysis, Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) is a visual field analysis aid used to quantify visual field progression. This analysis aid is specific to Humphrey perimeters. The GPA Trend Analysis component quantifies the observed rate of change of the visual field. This metric is reported as percent loss per year (VFI) OR estimated mean deviation decibel loss per year, along with confidence limits for the slope estimate., This measurement will automatically be generated after five Humphrey visual field tests and is updated with each subsequent test. Subjects will only complete one Humphrey visual field during the study, so this metric will be taken from historic data.|Visual Field Loss Trend Metric #2 - EyeSimplify Mean Deviation Progression Trend, The EyeSimplify Progression Trend is a visual field analysis aid used to quantify visual field progression. This analysis aid is specific to EyeSimplify and quantifies the observed rate of change of subjects' mean deviation.

To date, no adverse side effects have been observed.

With accurate staging, the investigators aim to save patients from side effects of insufficient or too extensive treatment. The investigators hypothesize that precise staging will lead to optimized individualized treatment and subsequently to prolonged survival and increased quality of life.

Prostate cancer is a very heterogeneous disease varying from indolent tumors to aggressive cancer types. About one-fifth of patients with newly detected high- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer present with bone metastases and their 3-years survival is less than 50%. Precise staging is required for planning relevant treatment that has the potential to increase survival.

The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and can serve as a target for precise diagnosis and staging. PSMA-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has shown to be more accurate than traditional imaging, but there is a need for prospective trials analyzing the impact of primary staging with PSMA-PET/CT on treatment planning and patient benefit.

In a prospective multicenter study, the investigators plan to include 448 patients and randomize 1:1 to either traditional imaging or PSMA-PET/CT.

Intraoperatively, the SCOUT hand-held device is then percutaneously applied to the breast or lymph node, creating an audible signal on the device console with a gradient which correlates to distance (in mm) from the target lesion and marker.

The Savi Scout surgical guidance system was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014. Furthermore, it was approved for long term use, with no restrictions on the length of time in 2017.

The system consists of an implantable reflector with a 4-mm body size, preloaded in a 16-gauge deliverable needle, a hand-held probe and a console. The reflector consists of an IR light receptor, resistor switch and two antennae. This is placed into or near the target through a 16G needle under mammographic or sonographic guidance. The hand-held probe detects pulses of infrared (IR) light and radar wave signals, received by the console system, which then emits and receives signals back to the reflector to provide real time localization and target proximity information to the surgeon.

The SCOUT console provides audible and visual feedback intraoperatively, the frequency of which increases as the handheld reader approaches the implanted reflector.

NCT05043961,Palisade Lateral Branch Technique Using Multi-tined Needles for Sacro-iliac Joint Radiofrequency Ablation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05043961,TriPal,TERMINATED,"The sacro-iliac joint is a large joint that can be the source of chronic pain. Many treatment options have been proposed to treat SIJ pain, with variable efficacy. The next step in managing those patients who can't get sustained pain relief from conservative treatment is radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the SIJ's posterior innervation.

However, the success rate of SIJ RFA, as determined by the proportion of patients reporting greater than 50% pain relief 6 months after the intervention, varies substantially across studies, ranging from 38-71 %. This may be explained partly by the fact that there may be incomplete lesioning of the target nerves supplying the joint. To overcome these particularities, two RFA techniques have emerged: cooled RFA and bipolar RFA.

Cooled radiofrequency is the one that has been studied the most, and good evidence supports its efficacy. However, its superiority to conventional RF for the treatment of SIJ pain is not confirmed.

Alternatively, a bipolar RFA technique using conventional radiofrequency needles and equipment can be used. The efficacy of this relatively newer technique has been demonstrated by only one study, and although the results were promising, it is not known whether they could be replicated. The success of the palisade technique could be enhanced by using multi-tined expandable electrodes, such as the 3-tined Trident cannulas, with only small increases in cost.

In clinical practice, the palisade technique using 3-tines needles is routinely used. However, its efficacy has not been formally evaluated.

All items in both modules have response options in a 5-point (0-4) numerical rating scale, where 0 = not at all and 4 = all the time., Baseline to Week 52|Core Phase: Change from baseline in LCQ (Leicester Cough Questionnaire) scores to Week 52, The LCQ is a participant-reported questionnaire evaluating the impact of cough on quality of life. The LCQ comprises 19 items and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Each item assesses symptoms or the impact of symptoms over the last 2 weeks on a 7-point Likert scale. Scores in 3 domains (physical, psychological, and social) are calculated as a mean for each domain (range: 1-7). A total score (range: 3 to 21) is also calculated.

In some people with cancer a protein called Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) can prevent immune cells from fighting tumor cells. The study drug, BAY 2416964, is a small molecule which blocks the AhR allowing the body to use its immune response against the cancer cells. Researchers think that BAY 2416964 given together with a cancer treatment called pembrolizumab may help shrink tumors in people with cancer.

The main aims of this study are to find for BAY 2416964 in combination with pembrolizumab,

* how safe this drug combination is
* how it affects the body (also referred to as tolerability)
* the highest amount of BAY 2416964 that can be given in combination with pembrolizumab without too many side effects.

The researchers will also study the action of BAY 2416964 in combination with pembrolizumab against the cancer.

The participants in this study will get BAY 2416964 and pembrolizumab. BAY 2416964 will be given by mouth. Pembrolizumab will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion. An IV infusion is given through a needle into a vein.

This study will have two parts. The first part will help find the most appropriate dose that can be given in the second part.

Each participant of the first, so called dose escalation part, will be assigned to one specific dose group for BAY 2416964. The amount of BAY 2416964 that is given changes step-wise from one group to the next. The dose of pembrolizumab will always be the same.

The participants of the second, so called dose expansion part, will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY 2416964 found in the first part.

During the study, the participants will receive the treatment in 3-week periods called cycles. In each cycle, the participants will in general get pembrolizumab once and BAY 2416964 in a daily schedule. These 3-week cycles will be repeated throughout the trial. The participants can take the study treatment until their cancer gets worse, until they have medical problems, or until they leave the trial. Participants will have around 4 visits in each cycle. Some of the visits can also be done via phone.

During the study, the study doctors and their team will:

* take blood and urine samples
* check if the participants' cancer has changed in size using computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging scans of the participants' tumors
* check the participants' overall health
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

NCT04701112,Acute Hemodynamic Effects of Pacing the His Bundle in Heart Failure,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04701112,HEPA-His,TERMINATED,"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing (BVP) is indicated for patients with low ejection fraction and persistent symptoms of heart failure despite medical therapy and a wide QRS-complex, preferably with a left bundle branch block. Unfortunately, up to 40 % receiving CRT do not respond with subjective improvement or improved left ventricular ejection fraction from the treatment.

There are few therapeutic alternatives in patients not responding to CRT with BVP, and the potential to improve cardiac function in these patients could make a large difference in terms of life quality and prognosis.

His-bundle pacing (HBP) can be a suitable alternative, but is likely not possible in all patients with failed CRT. Furthermore, upgrading to HBP does require a surgical procedure and therefore exposes the patients to risk of complications (e.g. infection of the device). Therefore, early identification of the patients who are likely to benefit from an upgrade to HBP would be beneficial.

This study aims to evaluate if patients with failed CRT treatment will benefit from hemodynamic improvement if they are treated with temporary HBP, without opening the device-pocket, and exposing the existing pacemaker-device to a risk of infection. A temporary pacemaker lead and pacing sheath will be used, and placed in the heart via a blood vessel on the right side of neck, using local anaesthesia. Acute effects on the pump function of the heart will be measured during rest and during supine bicycle test (the equivalent of moderate physical activity). Factors associated with a beneficial effect will be evaluated on a group basis.

NCT04581603,CBT-I Augmentation of Medication for Drinking in AUD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04581603,,TERMINATED,"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and insomnia are more prevalent in Veterans than in the general community. Furthermore, insomnia is comorbid in 36-91% of individuals with AUD and jeopardizes recovery by increasing their risk for relapse and complicating their clinical profile. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend four medications for the treatment of AUD by promoting abstinence and a reduction in drinking. Two of these medications (MED) used commonly are naltrexone and topiramate but they do not improve sleep continuity or insomnia. The recommended treatment for insomnia is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), and it has shown efficacy in improving insomnia but with minimal benefit in improving abstinence. However, these studies have involved subjects in early or sustained remission. The proposed study will evaluate whether augmenting MED with CBT-I, after reducing drinking or achieving abstinence, bolsters recovery in AUD, by decreasing insomnia and improving abstinence.

NCT04381429,Effect of Postprandial Insulin Administration of Faster-acting Insulin Analogue Versus Pre-prandial Administration of Acting-insulin Analogue in Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04381429,MIRE,TERMINATED,"Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a major factor of morbidity and mortality at all disease stages. Insulin deficiency has serious clinical consequences by increasing malnutrition, since protein and lipid catabolism is accelerated in chronic infections. Traditionally, insulin is injected before a meal. Yet, in these patients with highly varied and often staggered nutritional intakes, insulin injection can result in an increased risk of postprandial hypoglycaemia, all the more so as CF patients exhibit decreased glucagon secretion.

Recent progress in the development of new insulins mimicking the physiological secretion more closely has led to ultra-fast insulins (fast aspart), allowing for postprandial hyperglycaemia to be better controlled. In Type 1 diabetics treated with basal-bolus, faster-acting aspart insulin injected after a meal enabled metabolic control comparable to injection of aspart insulin prior to the meal. Fast apart insulin is of particular interest with regard to CFRD, wherein postprandial hyperglycaemia occurs early. In CFRD, these insulins are likewise advantageous in that they can be injected after the meal, thus permitting more flexibility in patients with highly varied diets. Moreover, the insulin dose can be adapted depending on dietary intake, thus preventing hypoglycaemia secondary to highly-varied carbohydrate intakes. Due to its flexibility, this insulin therapy is likely to be better accepted by patients with cystic fibrosis.",NO,Cystic Fibrosis-related Diabetes,DRUG: A-F-A-F (NovoRapid-FIASP-NovoRapid-FIASP)|DRUG: F-A-F-A (FIASP-NovoRapid-FIASP-NovoRapid),"Change of time in range of blood glucose variation (70-180 mg/dl) versus baseline at the end of each treatment period of 3 months (the last 2 weeks of the period of 3 months) is assessed., This measurement is assessed at the end of each treatment period of 3 months (the last 2 weeks of the period of 3 months).

PD: at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., From the date of first response to the date of first documented tumor progression, death due to any cause or data cut-off date whichever comes first (maximum duration: 116 weeks)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to Estrogen Receptor 1 Gene (ESR1) Mutation Status, PFS defined as the time (in months) interval from the date of randomization to the date of first documented tumor progression as per RECIST 1.1 assessed by ICR or death (due to any cause), whichever comes first. Progression as per RECIST 1.1: at least a 20 percent (%) increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The mutation status (wild type, mutant) of twelve specific mutations of the ESR1 gene was determined by multiplex droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), including their mutant frequency and concentration. Here, PFS is reported based on the ESR1 mutation status of participants: wild type and mutants. ESR1 was the gene encoding estrogen receptor alpha. ESR1 mutant type breast cancer was a disease where the ESR1 gene had a mutation (i.e., a type of error). ESR1 wild type breast cancer was a disease where the ESR1 gene was normal without a mutation.

These include 5 functional scales, 9 symptom scales, \& Global Health Status/quality of life scale (GHS/QoL). All 14 items/domains were scored on scale of 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) and GHS/QoL, scored on scale of 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). All scales are transformed from raw scores to linear scales ranging 0 to 100. Higher score for functional \& GHS/QoL = higher level of functioning, \& higher score for symptoms scales = higher symptom burden. Least Square (LS) mean and Standard Error (SE) are derived from MMRM model with change from Baseline values as response variable, treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, Baseline value and stratifications factors as fixed effect.

Pregnant, healthy women are recommended to do 30 minutes or more of light to moderate exercise a day, although most women in the Western world do not follow current recommendations and decrease their exercise level.

Benefits of exercise during pregnancy are several, including a protective effect against the development of gestational diabetes mellitus, reduced pregnancy related low back pain, and risk of caesarean delivery. On the contrary, a recent review concludes that sedentary behaviors are associated with higher levels of C Reactive Protein and LDL Cholesterol, a larger newborn abdominal circumference, and macrosomia.

Previous studies show that exercise during pregnancy is associated with improvements in psychological well-being among previously sedentary women.

T-lymphocytes (T-cells) are part of the immune system and can attack when they recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors. In most patients with advanced cancer, T-cells are not stimulated enough to kill the tumor. In this research study, we will use a patient's tumor to make a vaccine which we hope will stimulate T-cells to kill tumor cells and leave normal cells alone.

High grade gliomas (HGGs) are very aggressive and difficult for the body's immune system to attack. Before T-cells can become active against tumor cells, they require strong stimulation by special ""stimulator"" cells in the body called Dendritic Cells (DCs) which are also part of the immune system. DCs can recognize the cancer cells and then activate the T lymphocytes, and create this strong stimulation.

The purpose of this research study is to learn whether anti-tumor T-cells and anti-tumor DC vaccines can be given safely.

PCOS is usually characterized by an excessive androgen production, menstrual irregularities, and polycystic ovaries. Women with PCOS are often obese and have a varying degree of insulin resistance (IR). Weight reduction constitutes the initial treatment for these patients. Metformin has proven to be useful in IR and is frequently used in PCOS. However metformin use may be accompanied by gastrointestinal discomfort, and a high abandon rate. Other therapeutic alternatives such as magnesium and polyunsaturated fatty acids have been used in other IR states and may be useful in PCOS.

There also is clinical equipoise on whether the addition of vancomycin to routine cefazolin prophylaxis can further reduce s-SSI rates. A short duration of combined antimicrobial prophylaxis can reduce side effects of exposure to antimicrobials such as infections with C. difficile or emergence of resistance, but may also reduce the incidence of s-SSIs. The objective of the eventual full scale study is to determine whether adding vancomycin to cefazolin can reduce SSIs as well as whether short-term prophylaxis is as effective as long-term prophylaxis.

NCT01862107,Cerebrospinal Fluid Collection and Repository Storage,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01862107,,TERMINATED,"Background:

- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the liquid around the brain and spinal cord. Many diseases can only be diagnosed by examining the CSF. A lumbar puncture is used to collect and test CSF. Once someone is already having a lumbar puncture, a small extra amount of CSF can be collected at the same time. This fluid can be used to study brain, nerve, and related health issues. Researchers want to collect CSF and blood samples from people who are scheduled to have a lumbar puncture.

Objectives:

- To collect cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples from individuals who are having a lumbar puncture.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between 2 and 100 years of age who are scheduled to have a lumbar puncture for clinical or research purposes.

Design:

* Participants will have a lumbar puncture for clinical or research purposes.
* During the procedure, an additional sample of CSF will be collected. They will also provide a blood sample, if one is not taken at the time of the procedure.
