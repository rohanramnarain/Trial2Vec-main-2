NCT05357950,"A Phase IIb, Multi-Center, Multinational, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study, With an Open Label Extension, to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of PrimeC in Subjects With ALS",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05357950,PARADIGM,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"69 subjects with ALS will be enrolled in the study and randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive the study drug or placebo tablets. Randomization sequences will be in random block sizes and stratified for ENCALS risk category \[high risk ≥ -4.5 vs. low risk \< -4.5\], and for background ALS treatment (riluzole and/or edaravone and/or sodium phenylbutyrate and/or taurursodiol) vs. no background ALS treatment.

All subjects will be administered the drug/placebo twice daily (BID), two tablets each time, for 6 months. Subjects will be allowed to receive standard of care (SOC) treatment of approved products (i.e., riluzole and edaravone). Additionally, subjects will be allowed to receive treatment with off-label sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, which are accepted for ALS treatment.

Subjects will be evaluated every 2 months for safety, tolerability (adverse events, safety laboratory, vital signs, ECG, withdrawal rates and reasons) and efficacy (e.g. biomarkers, clinical outcomes (ALSFRS-R and SVC, quality of life and survival).

All subjects who complete the 6 months dosing will be switched to the active arm for a 12-month open label extension (OLE).",NO,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis|ALS,DRUG: PrimeC|DRUG: Placebo,"Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Treatment emergent adverse event is any medical event associated with the drug, 6 months|Number of subjects who discontinued treatment prematurely, Number of subjects whose treatment is stopped prematurely for any reason, 6 months|Number of patients who discontinued treatment prematurely due to adverse events, Number of patients whose treatment is stopped prematurely specifically due to adverse events, 6 months|Number of patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, 6 months|The mean difference between PrimeC and Placebo in serum concentration of NDE TDP-43 at month 6, 6 months|The mean difference between PrimeC and placebo in serum concentration of NDE PgJ2 at month 6, 6 months","Change from baseline to 6 months in ALS functional rating scale - revised (ALSFRS-R), 6 months|Change from baseline to 6 months in slow vital capacity (SVC), 6 months|Change from baseline to 6 months in quality of life ALSSQOL-SF, 6 months|Change from baseline to 6 months in PROMIS-10 quality of life questionnaire, 6 months|Survival at 6 months of treatment, Overall Survival defined as time to death from any cause at 6 months of treatment, 6 months|Composite survival at 6 months of treatment, Composite of overall survival, defined as time to death from any cause, or respiratory insufficiency (defined as tracheostomy or the use of non-invasive ventilation for ≥22 h per day for ≥10 consecutive days) at 6 months of treatment, 6 months|Composite survival at 6 months of treatment, Composite of overall survival, defined as time to death from any cause, or respiratory insufficiency (defined as tracheostomy or the use of non-invasive ventilation for ≥22 h per day for ≥10 consecutive days), or time to hospitalization due to ALS-related complications at 6 months of treatment, 6 months|Joint Assessment of Function and Survival after 6 months of treatment, 6 months","Change from baseline to 6 months in the following serum biomarkers: serum ferritin, transferrin, iron, neurofilaments and exosomal LC3, Dicer, and other biomarkers evaluating the effect of PrimeC on pathophysiological mechanisms in ALS, 6 months|Effect of PrimeC versus placebo on the time to reach advanced disease stages (King's/MiToS), 6 months|Change from baseline to 6 months in Patient-ranked order of function (PROOF), 6 months",NeuroSense Therapeutics Ltd.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,69,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",NST003,2022-05-31,2023-11-02,2024-11,2022-05-03,,2023-12-07,"Lawson Health Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada|Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel|IRCCS Istituti clinici Maugeri, Milano, Italy|A.O.U.
