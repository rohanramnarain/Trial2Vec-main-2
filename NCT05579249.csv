NCT05579249,A Research Study Comparing Wegovy to Other Weight Management Drugs in People Living With Obesity in America,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05579249,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this post approval pragmatic clinical study is to see how well semaglutide lowers body weight compared to other medication on the market used to treat obesity, across three US-based employers. These employers represent employees of diverse demography and job functions including hospitality, clerical, administrative, housekeeping, maintenance, and specialised employees across a range of socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. The study will also look at how weight loss affects physical functioning, quality of life and ability to work. It will also gather information on how satisfied participants are with the medication they take. Participants will either receive semaglutide or one of 4 approved anti-obesity medication (Xenical/Qsymia/Contrave/Saxenda).",NO,Obesity,DRUG: Semaglutide|DRUG: Orlistat|DRUG: Phentermine/Topiramate|DRUG: Naltrexone/Bupropion|DRUG: Liraglutide,"Number of Participants Who Achieve Body Weight Reduction Greater Than Equal To (≥) 10.0 Percentage (%) (Yes/No), Measured as count of participants., At week 52","Change in Body Weight, Measured in percentage., Week 0 to week 52|Change in Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite For Clinical Trials (IWQOL-Lite-CT) Physical Function Domain, IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 20-item patient reported outcome instrument used to assess the impact of body weight changes on patients' physical and psychosocial functioning in three composite scores (physical function, physical and psychosocial) and a total score. The possible score range for physical function score is 0 to 100. Higher values on physical function score of the IWQOL-Lite-CT indicate improved patient functioning.

It is a self-administrated questionnaire consisting of 4 domains of work limitation: Time Management (5), Physical Demands (6), Mental/Interpersonal (9), Output Demands (5). The responses are used to calculate a total WLQ index score. Lower scores indicate less work limitation.
